Last month, we collected         your feedback through a building access survey.

We learned         that members of our community place different priorities on campus         safety, ease of access, and a welcoming environment for visitors, and         that any successful solution must balance all of these values.

Its a little disconcerting getting through an advanced EE degree without even having access to a proper controls course, RF circuits, or even an advanced analog circuit design course in general that has exposure to concepts that I cannot just learn from a textbook or just screwing around with a Cadence license 6.775, 6.374, 6.302.  It makes me really believe Ive simply wasted my time here, especially when every attempt at doing research has hit a dead end from losing funding, while I see people around me swing a CSAIL RAship to fund their degree doing yet another project of slapping ML on an alreadyproven concept and publishing.  Thats not to say there arent people within the department fighting to keep it alive. Steinmeyers contributions to 6.111 and 6.08 and Leebs 6.115 and 6.131 have to be the highlight of my academic experience here. But to be honest, I would consider most EE classes past that are very lackluster.  Was this department ever better than this Or am I simply witnessing its death", "I have observed this as well. Its due to a few reasons. The EECS department focuses funding on where grant money flows in and where student demand is. CS just plain more lucrative, from a financial standpoint, than EE is. Industry pays more to CS grads, and funding agencies give lots more money to CSML research because it has faster tangible returns and is hyped up right now. Even a lot of EE research now is just applying ML to insert problem. I dont have any solutions for you other than making admin more aware of this problem although they already are, but making a fuss about it is more likely to change things. I dont think this problem is unique to MIT either. From my knowledge, even though other top schools you mentioned might have more available EE courses I think they have similar problems in terms of funding and enrollment. Another problem here is a lot of the EE faculty are old dinosaurs that should have retired already, and since the department prioritizes hiring CS over EE profs you get more profs taking sabbaticals and not designing new EE electives and such instead of getting new blood to shake things up.  Also, please post this to the Course 6 piazza dm for link if you dont have it yet. I think discourse there would be very useful and admins actually read posts there.", "Yep, that is my experience so far. Came here as a course 8 that then wanted to do something more handson, and interesting so I moved to course 62 and now Im seriously considering making the step for 61 only thing that stops me is trying to take a weird computer architecturesemiconductor combination of classes and then use the MEng to choose whether to take the CS path or the EE path.  But then, when I was about to take classes this semester what did I find Most of the important header classes like 6.012, 6.011 and 6.013 are only offered in Spring, leaving only advanced classes or lab classes for those interested in EE which prompted me to currently take 6.301. 6.01 got killed and it seems like it will never be offered again and with the current change eliminating intro classes I wonder if 6.02 and 6.08 will go the same route.  I search up for EE classes in the curriculum and it always seems like you are forced to take grad classes to advance your knowledge, or you are confined to the limited 1 or 2 intro classes that introduce you to a subject.", "As a 25 in Course 8, I really wanted to go the 861 route because of how streamlined they made each major. A few months ago, however, a friend told me that they went to a an official course 6 event and there wasnt a single 61 representative there . So it seems like theyre trying to just kill off the major. In fact, at the initial associate advisor meeting the department heads of course 6 explicitly said that people interested in EE should do the new 62. I understand that EECS is moving in a new direction but there will always be a need for 61 people to actually build the circuits for the rest of course 6.", "This has been a major frustration of mine my entire time here.", "Its really ironic because they EE Undergrad Office touted the new 62 as a more modern EE branch. But I think that viewpoint is heavily skewed by just how much MIT wants to cram computing into stuff. A 61 asked them about why 61 was being phased out, and they justified it by saying that you cant do EE without CS anymore based of their conversations with industry partners I guess. Hence, the change.", "I was around in 2010ish and it was already starting then Analog Way classes got cut back, if I remember correctly, making it impossible for some students to take all of them based on phasing. Im now on the other side, working fulltime in EE analog and mixedsignal VLSI and doing college recruiting at MIT. Everything youre saying appears true to me. Honestly, at this point, Id put the UMich curriculum above MIT.", "I hear you OP and others, and Im sorry that weve had to cancel several of our more advanced circuits classes recently due to a combination of leaves  sabbaticals. Some of the classes you list are coming up again 6.374 is being offered this term, 6.161 will be offered next term. But yeah, its been kind of a perfect storm on the circuits side, and youre only here a limited time, so I get it.      But let me say this loudly we love EE. In fact, weve been working like crazy, the EE faculty collectively, to create a new EE curriculum the new 62 and revise or introduce over 20 classes. Here are some things you might be interested in      Quantum systems engineering we have a new track in this area, one class 6.2400 being piloted this Fall, and a lab class being piloted in Spring. This is quantum engineering, not quantum physics.       Energy another poster raised the point that we need more classes on energy. Yup We are piloting a new class in this area in Spring 6.2200. Its a full stack view of the field, from energy transduction to the power grid. And weve just hired a new faculty member in this area, so expect more classes soon.      Wanna go down the stack How about the new 6.2540, where you go and fabricate nanodevices. Or the newly revised 6.1526.2600, which is a topdown fab class, with a project of your own choosing at the end.      I know 6.161 is being moved to spring, but thats because we are introducing a new Silicon Photonics class this Fall 6.S046. Want to learn how to sense or compute with light Both theory and handson Check it out. We are also piloting a computational imaging class 6.S045, mixing optics with computation to design new imaging systems.      On the biomedical side, we have a new Biomedical Systems class 6.4800 coming in Spring, descended from 6.03, but at a more sophisticated level.       And in spring also comes 6.9000 Engineering for Impact, where well design fullstack and I mean really fullstack systems sensors, electronics, compute. Focused on a societal need. Should be fun.      And yes, we want tapeout too We are introducing a new junior level active devices course 6.2080, that, along wiht 6.3016.2090 will introduce an analog tapeout. The hard part about tapeout is that we dont just want to ship a design. We want to get the silicon back and test it. And fab runs take time, so hard to fit into a semester. So were splitting that experience across these two classes.      On the digital side, were also thinking about how to get tapeouts. 6.374 is now using the Skywater PDK along with Cadence.      And dont forget about 6.334 its not integrated circuits, but the class is fantastic, and theres no one better to learn power electronics from than Dave Perreault.      OP, if your academic advisor isnt familiar with all these newrevised classes, Id be happy to give some advice, just DM me and we can meet up.      So weve been busy, and we hope you like what weve been planning.      But please, keep up the unfiltered feedback. We can always do better. Keep us honest.       We love EE", "61 BS 07 one of eight that year, MEng 11, PhD 16, and postoc until about 2018 here  I, too, absolutely loved 6.115 and 6.131, and Id argue that most of what I do for a living is based on these classes.  I may show my age with some of these suggestions, and I hope I dont sound like Im ranting.  I spent the majority of my time at MIT in LEES now RLE down in 10050 doing electric machinery.  If youre interested, take 6.6856.690 Kirtleys electric machinerypower systems and 6.334 Perreaults power electronics.  Electric machinery is mostly field theory mixed with a bunch of spatial concepts.  6.334 touches on control concepts and lots of basic electronics, as well as some pretty cool math to solve odd problems that may have been Perreaults advanced power electronics class.  In any case, people seem to care much more about electric machinery again now that robotics and cars even aircraft are in search of everincreasing power density and efficiency.  My thesis project was the motors in Sangbae Kims cheetah, and Ive had several projects in the real world related to clever cramming of power into smaller and smaller spaces.  If youre looking for controls and are a masochist in the linear algebra sense, check out Megretskis 6.241.  Youll learn more than you knew there was to know about statespace models and different types of stability.  I sucked at this at the time.  Ten years later, I seriously appreciate it.  6.631 Fujimotos optics and photonics was also really good.  All of the aforementioned classes are weedout classes for their respective labs.  Theyre not to be taken lightly.  6.302 used to be awesome when Roberge taught it.  I dont know who has it now, but youre 15 years late for him.  If you didnt do it as an undergrad, take 8.03.  Then again, I caught Lewin in his prime for this one.  Now that I look at my list, I might agree with you  a lot of these guys have left or quit teaching and Im not sure theyve been replaced.  If youre interested in VLSI stuff, make sure youve brushed up on all your thermal stuff.  2.005 with Brisson was one of the more useful classes I took.  It can mostly be reduced to lumped parameter models which should look very familiar to you, but its useful to think about that math in terms of heat, especially as thermal considerations increasingly dominate performance of devices.  My minor for my PhD was MechE, though Im not sure youre still required to have a minor.  I will say though  the basics apply to all of this.  It took me a long time to realize that the math is all the same and connected.  8.03 is the base, and pretty much anything you ever wanted to do can be done with that and an understanding of linear algebra not the 18.06 type, but real linear algebra, which Strang also does very well.  Controls especially.  I almost think that 8.03 could have been taught before or in place of 18.03.  And the ML comments above  you can certainly do a lot of cool stuff there.  I think youll find that a good understanding of the basics can be used to reduce problems to something more tractable, that you can then set the ML and other bruteforce approaches on more effectively.  I used to say, He who said brute force didnt work wasnt using enough.  Now Im a big proponent of expanding the search area to fit the amount of brute force available.  I keep coming back to this  What MIT does really well is hammer in the fundamentals.  We suck at providing context, both in why youre learning things, how its applicable, and separately all the other stuff that contributes to mental health.  You can learn individual, specialized things, but youll find that a solid base will get you through damn near anything, and itll probably take you a while to realize just how flexible and applicable all these things really are.  I really hope this approach doesnt die as bruteforce methods become more powerful  they complement each other.", "Wow. The list of canceled classes is really sad. Particularly since I enjoyed 6.776 so much.  This was the case a few years ago, but from what you describe, the situation sounds even worse now.  Ill extend this to you OP or any other MIT people interested in circuit design. If circuit design is what you want to do, send me a DM and Ill give you more detail on who I work forask around to see if we have openings.", "EE at MIT is so completly devoid of any insights or standard practices outside its own little academic bubble. Classes dropped left and right and new ones pop up that, sure, might be interesting but dont really do anything to advance your professional development or research. I did my research in optoelectronics and literally had to teach everything myself because there was never a class taught for the subject. Theres still some some solid state phenomenon that I still dont fully understand even after graduating. Take a physics class you say Well the department doesnt accept those toward your degree and every department makes every class overly hard for no reason. So either come into the program with all the knowledge youll ever need or dont do a thesis that requires physical experiments because you cant accomplish both. How about learn on the job after What they dont tell you is there is basically no semiconductor industry in the U.S. period. The average engineer is over 50. The people getting hired are from schools with feeder programs like Stanford, Berkeley and UofA not MIT  because MIT doesnt reinforce or teach anything relevant. Do yourself a favor and switch to CS.", "do you know if the course 6 piazza is anonymous The only reason I didnt post it there is because Im not sure if critiquing how certain classes are run could potentially come back to bite me", "Which is funny, given that ML is also kinda shallow in the MIT curriculum options being 6.036 and the grad class 6.867. There are a couple of related classes but you can only do so much with a field that is basically repeating the same 45 learning models over and over with changes in the representation...", "6.08 is definitely on the same route. My friend emailed Joe about TAing for the class and he said that he wasnt teaching it in the spring anymore. No one is.", "I absolutely agree, and it doesnt really make sense to me. It seems as though MIT likes advocating for serious efforts such as sustainable energy and renewable power grids... and yet we have a grand total of 1 graduate level power electronics course that teaches anything relevant to building power systems, and it may as well be an introductory course compared to the content Ive seen taught at other schools.  So why advocate for sustainability when MIT diverts funds from the labs that are actively researching solutions to energy storage and the actual engineering that goes into sustainability", "I was a 14 61 and that explanation makes sense to me. If youre interested in that side of EE, why is structuring your 62 curriculum to be EE focused not enough", "What do you think UMich is doing differently to retain their EE program quality", "I once told my academic advisor when I was still in the program that I didnt feel like I was learning anything, that there was no classes within my focus area and that I didnt feel my progress, education and professional development was at a similar level to those in similar programs that I had met through research. I went to him because i didnt know what to do to get back on track. He told me that I should seriously consider dropping out. I elevated this to the department and effectively got told the same thing. Maybe the department is finally pulling its shit together but in my view its been dead for a long time and theres little interest to change, just words. Until the EE department proves me wrong my advice to anyone thinking about MIT EE is to seriously consider your other options as your educational and post academia opportunities might very well exceed what MIT can deliver.", "6.302 is actually still being offered. Its now a major req of the new 62.", "You can post as anonymous to everyone when you post to piazza, which makes it so no one can see who is posting even admins of the page. Even so, people post stuff critiquing the department there frequently so I dont think this is something you should worry about. Its a forum to raise questions that the department should answer.", "You can find more material if youre not looking for the exact ML label. Like 6.435 with Broderick. Fantastic class on Bayesian Inference and Modeling, Id call it nearly a must take for anyone going in that direction. 6.231 on the reinforcement learning side of things only really overlaps with 036 on basic Q learning. The math department has some great classes too, like Strangs. I think the popular conception of ML just obscures that its largely a repackaging of richer fields from dynamic programming to variational calculus and statistical modeling. We definitely have a solid curriculum on those underlying fields, and taking them will likely serve someone better than just a handbook of currently popular models", "theyll probably put more resources into ml in the future with the whole schwartzman thing, its just still early years. im expecting 64 to go through a lot of changes as the shiny new ml major.", "Damn I heard rumors about 6.08 not sticking around much longer but it hurts to hear it happening so soon.

Doesnt help that the communities I found myself in didnt resonate with my problems because if they were in the course 6 major, they were 63, and we were also kicked off campus for a year and a half, so I dont think I felt I was in the best position to give constructive criticism.", "Still seems like you can construct an amazingly EE focused curriculum out of that.

Ive used spaced repetition more for HASShumanities classes like History, Foreign Languages, Finance.

I have many boxes of flashcards for these classes its not terribly subtle. History, I usually didnt have a ton of flashcards.  Engineering classes have a different pedagogy like you read the textbook, go through the lecture, you review the lecture, you do the problem set, you practice with previous years and terms tests and finals, you go to review sessions, etc. The subject evaluations when I was at MIT, it was the Course Evaluation Guide, but Ive learned that administration has taken over that role and you need Kerberos authentication to see the subject evaluations are a really good source of information on what is most helpful.  Sometimes I reviewed the pset as soon as I got it, and then kept an eye on the pset whenever we went through materials in lecture so Id crossreference in my notes and on my copy of the pset.  Sometimes Id review previous lectures when I had time e.g., before the next lecture started.  Sometimes  what helped most is talking with classmates or the TAs, even without pencil and paper, walking through how to do the pset to see if I understood the material.  Sometimes what helped most was going to tutorials like my 6.003 TA had awesome tutorials where he mined the last 5 years worth of exams and finals and gave it to us as a handout, relevant to the weeks worth of lectures. He would mostly have us walk through how to set up the questions and start solving  and while it was completely optional, the three of us religiously attended every tutorial. And I tried to put the tutorial on the days I didnt have lecturesrecitations.  Sometimes I felt it was more efficient to do the problem sets or as much of it as possible in a longer session rather than multiple short sessions, although the more difficult ones, I might attempt multiple times and even over multiple dayssessions.

Repairs would have cost enough to require bringing the building up to current building code. Which was prohibitively expensive, and would greatly reduce its capacity.  After that fiasco of losing a building through ineptitude, I noted that MIT put a lot of very careful work into repairing and repointing the bricks on the DuPont Armory and the Metropolitan Storage Warehouse. Maintenance matters, and has to be competent.", "The bigger point was that you blamed Bexley students for the demolition by claiming they refused to allow renovations. Thats not at all what happened.", "Oh it absolutely is. For years they fought hard to keep incremental repairs from being made. I know, because I know some of the people who did this. And perhaps the eventual decay of the building was inevitable, but they also completely declined any efforts to preserve their culture by refusing any option other than doing nothing and continuing to live there. MIT tried to offer options that involved keeping big chunks of the population together in other buildings there was of course nowhere big enough to house everyone together, but they refused, so they got nothing. And then they blamed the administration for supposedly hating students and student culture. Its the East Campus cycle of self destruction. Ive seen it over and over again.  And now we have an OP who is only asking that necessary renovations not happen at all, and the building be allowed to continue decaying.  At just about any other college in the country, if a dorm needed renovations, the administration would just say, okay, everybody out and not care whatsoever about any fallout. MIT has actually been pretty incredible at trying to provide options during renovations. And yes, sometimes old people who may not have ever gone to MIT may be out of touch, but theres a levelheaded, mature way to address that and negotiate, but it cant happen if the students are being immature buttholes and making unreasonable demands.

However, Ive started doing this, and I feel less confident about my ability to perform well on upcoming tests and midterms because Im taking so long that I likely wont get through all the practice problems and Im not seeing speed improvements to my problem solving in reference to novel questions. Is this feeling normal, and if not, why could this not be working for me", "This I think is definitely normal when you first get started. The idea behind trying to solve things yourself first before asking for help or looking at the solutions is to get better at recognizing patterns in problems, which will make you a better problem solver in the long run.  I dont think theres anything wrong with asking for help going to OH asking a friend on a question thats youve made a good faith attempt at solving. Because at that point youre investing enough in the problem so that its solution is one you remember.  I suggest revisiting these problems that used to take you a long time and make sure you understood the high level pattern  concepts associated with them. Try solving it in a narrative fashion like youre teaching it to someone, and justify each step along the way. Doing this can help you identify gaps in your knowledge.  At least this was all relevant in my experience as a first year, hopefully this is helpful", "Im a 23, and Ive finished all my theoretical requirements. I have never once solved a practice problem to test prep in any class. I still do well on tests, and you can too Its a style thing.  I learn more efficiently by reading the problem, thinking about how I would do it for not more than 15 min and carefully reading through the solution path.   For my coursework, all problems are problem solving challenges, and I get more from putting effort into understanding optimal solution paths and logic rather than bashing my head on a wall to get a suboptimal path. Im busy. If I only have 2 hours to study often less, Id like to spend that time getting more insight on rather than messing with the problem specifics.   If youre worried about going into your first test at MIT, your TAs could be right, speed might be an issue. I still think spending your limited study time on more practice problems will be more helpful. I will say though, I did Sci Oly and Sci UIL in HS and am very used to grinding out questions efficiently, so time hasnt been a problem.  If the nerves are making you slower, remember ur on PNR and the 8.02 test is gonna be hella curved. The first test average was a 44 or smth when I took it. That  curved to a 70", "I found MIT to be a lot of pattern matching problems to their type of solution, especially in 8.01 and 8.02  early level math classes. I think that doing lots of them does really help, but also separating them into clusters of the same type of problem and tackling them in that way.", "Its normal. When youre looking at solutions, youre probably thinking, Oh yeah, that makes a ton of sense. You just need to see the connections between different steps. But when youre working on problems, you need to independently come up with the next step, and thats way harder.", "I think your approach is really good but also requires being extremely honest with yourself e.g after reading the solution, did it really match up with the solution I came up in those 15 min or am I pretending that I understood. But ig this could be said about most study methods", "What is the difference between the Focused and Flexible option in Physics", "I know that the major requirements are different and that the Focused option appears to be more intensive, but is there a time difference Work difference Is it like the difference between AP Physics 1 and AP Physics C meaning one is relatively easy and doesnt involve a lot of things whereas the other is quite intense and difficult Could somebody give a comparecontrast between the two  Thanks in advance", "The only difference is Focused requires specific classes that you dont have to take for Flex. Diploma says the same thing. Work differences are caused by different classes so then its more of a question of the differences of those classes.", "Most people I know take flex, even if they dont intend to double major. It gives them the choice between taking one of the requirements of the focused option and a class in another discipline, or even to take more advanced physics courses that would be tough to fit in 8 focused.  I dont think any of the majors at MIT have significant time differences, unless you come in with a shit ton of transfer credit. Even then, among the people I know, there doesnt seem to be a strong association between course and workload. Im curious to hear what others think though", "Any DD groups out there", "Im a secondyear graduate student who has been looking for a bit to join a DD group to start campaigning with or join an already running one.  Used to play a few years ago, really have been yearning to get back into it.", "Id love to play but unfortunately finding a person willing to DM has been difficult for me my past DMing ventures have not been amazing so I hesitate to offer", "Check out Pandemonium in Central Square. If I recall, they host weekly DD there, although it might cost 10 bucks or so. Seems like a great way to meet a playgroup", "Id love to play as well. Maybe we can form a small group and find someone to DM.", "That sounds great", "Lost dog", "", "5000 reward", "hope they find this poor baby", "I guess so.  Its not my dog, Im just sharing.", "Does 2.740 Bioinspired Robotics have a course webpage", "I was unable to take 2.740 this semester and was wondering if the current class has a publicly available webpage like Tedrakes classes I know the class is mostly lab based but I was trying to follow along with the material they are learning. Thanks.", "Im in 2.74 same class, undergrad version and as far as Im aware there is no publicly accessible course webpage. I have, however, been compiling course materials into a Google Drive folderhttpsdrive.google.comdrivefolders1U2HJ1sAox6rg8kWQOXSPiP0s2Q55Qtuspsharing which you are welcome to access.", "Does anyone have a syllabus", "You are a legend, thank you ", "httpsdrive.google.comfiled1tlxCeQHsLXDSiEC3fLfBvS7vX5QpBzEtviewuspsharinghttpsdrive.google.comdrivefolders1U2HJ1sAox6rg8kWQOXSPiP0s2Q55Qtuspsharing", "Selling 2 GA tickets to see Jack Harlow 101022", "Hi all  During the summer I bought 2 GA standing room only tickets to see Jack Harlow on the day of 101022 but cant go anymore.

Thanks for the information", "L S C", "S  C K S ", "Immigration lawyers for OPT and visa application", "Does anyone have experience andor contacts for getting OPT andor a EB1, EB2, O1A after graduating from MIT or during their time at MIT   And do you have any lawyers you recommend  Many, many thanks in advance.", "In order to get an EB1 you will need to demonstrate extraordinary abilities in an academic field, be an outstanding professor or a multinational manager or executive. You didnt mention if you had graduated, however if you havent yet its probably going to be impossible for you to apply for this visa  unless you have Olympic medals or other very rare awards  at the time being. If you did graduate, then only a PhD and at least 3 years of experience in academia will do. Nevertheless, if you still want to apply there are two possibilities  you can apply for yourself by filling the form I140 or you can ask your current employer to fill it. I do not know if you have more chances by filling it yourself or not, its up to USCIS  only 3000 EB1 were granted in 2018 .   Now EB2, it is slightly more accessible although the number of visas granted every year is ridiculously low as well. You need to hold a bachelors degree or higher in the field you are intending to work in, have 5 years of experience in that same field and last but not least you need a valid job offer from a US company willing to sponsor you. You will need the general permanent labor certification and you will have to fill form I140.   O1A has pretty much the same application process as EB2. You need to have a job offer from a US employer and then prove extraordinary abilities through awards or be recognized by a famous institution  papers articles, original research etc. . Note that if you ever had a very high salary it counts as a proof of extraordinary skills  unless you sell oil I assume .  So thats for the 3 visas you mentioned. I may sound pessimistic about the odds of getting these visas but they are truly hard to get. Now only those who dont buy a lottery ticket cant win am I right   OPT is probably your best shot if you are still student at MIT or recently graduated. There are 2 types of OPT  pre OPT and OPT post completion. If you want to immigrate to the US permanently OPT post completion is what you are looking for as it allows you to work fulltime. It is valid for 12 months but if you are a STEM student you can extend it for an additional 2 years  also note that if you already did OPT for a bachelors degree, if you are currently enrolled in a masters degree it resets and you are good to go for another 13 years post graduation . You need to fill form I765 and form I20  which you probably did I am assuming . Also you need to get in touch with your designated school official who will recommend your application.   What I would suggest you is what many of my friends and I did   1. Marry a US citizen and become eligible for a green card  it is sadly the easiest way . 2. Start with OPT  hopefully you are a STEM major  and every year try to apply for a H1B visa. It is a visa that allows you to work in the US for a total period of 6 years and it gives you eligibility to seek for permanent residency. Typically 65 000 HB1 are granted every year and 20 000 additional visas are granted to applicants who own a masters degree. Your employer needs to sponsor you and prove that a US citizen cannot accomplish the tasks that you will be doing  for instance my mother was teacher in a French school based in Boston therefore she was eligible to apply for a H1B visa because not a lot of US citizens are capable of teaching in French. It doesnt have to be that specific and engineers in general tend to do pretty well I reassure you . This path is the easiest way to work in the US post graduation. In average, there are 180 000 applicants every year. Since 80 000 visas are granted every year, it gives you good chances to get it while you are doing OPT especially if you are a STEM major because you will have 3 years in a row to apply. Also make sure you will enjoy your job because you cannot work for another employer under an H1B. 3. You can apply for an EB3 visa. There again, your employer must prove you and only you can do this job. To be honest though EB visas are kind of hard to get in general but EB3 visas tend to be the most accessible ones. 4. Win the annual green card lottery. Definitely not a reliable solution but some good friends of mine could stay post graduation thanks to it and it saved them from a lot of troubles.    I unfortunately dont have any immigration lawyers to recommend you  the only one I knew is now retired  but I will look nonetheless and send you a private message if I ever find someone.   I hope this was helpful and informative, dont hesitate to ask if you have any questions and good luck   PS  in the title you ask for lawyers and contacts, I only shared my experience I hope my post answers your question.", "Hi OP, if you write to ISO, they will provide you with a list of recommended law firms in the Boston area.", "Maybe late to recommend, but the most straightforward way Ive seen is to join a big tech firm FAANG and apply for EB23 visa. Its a straightforward process and takes about 2 years until you get green card unless you are from China or India. From that sense, having MIT on the resume or not makes little difference.", "This was incredibly helpful and you went above and beyond. Thank you so much for taking the time and being so generous with your knowledge I am sure it has also helped many others on here.", "Brilliant info, I did not know that. Thank you so much Will get in touch with them.", "Im glad I could help.

Is there a specific reason for it Too advanced curriculum, exclusive MIT undergraduate program, or perhaps there is a massive demand for it that is too big for MIT to handle", "the eecs meng program is meant to be one year built directly on top of the four year undergrad program here its not really a standalone thing", "There is no EECS masters only program. It says this directly in the EECS admissions process page httpswww.eecs.mit.eduacademicsgraduateprogramsadmissionprocess. The MEng program is a compressed B.S.

Many schools rely on MS programs especially from international students as a cash cow.", "Oh so theres no way a student from another university can get into EECS at MIT I have seen in the website that it allows students of extraordinary potential or something like that but that they prioritize MIT students first   Oh wow 3 downvotes, looks like someones got superiority complex", "Theres also the Engineer degree that not many know about.", "Just for the few folks that might benefit from this, you CAN get an EECS M.S. degree without a PhD by currently being in a program like CSE SM, then taking double the courses to get both a CSE SM and an EECS M.S. not sure exactly how many courses though. I think the thesis can be the same as well, as long as the topic covers both programs.  People think if you have an EECS M.S. you either also have a PhD, currently doing a PhD, or dropped out. But theres also the fourth scenario where youre doingdid a double masters.", "phd programs are separate", "Yes but the applications for that are not through EECS. When you fill out a grad application for the EECS department there is only the option for the joint M.S. and PhD.  Dual M.S. programs are not usually handled by EECS directly. For example the LGO program is a joint MBAMS and you can get an EECS MS but applications are handled by Sloan. You also dont get RA research funding usually.

There was that random guy who blasted music and juggled under the dome at like 2am every week.  I remember I went to an IAP course on superconductivity once, and there was this local artist who showed up.  She clearly had no idea what the lecturer was talking about, but made a sincere effort to understand the material and asked questions that no physicist would have thought up.  The open campus just made these little experiences more likely.  Theyd make my day, and I still remember them years later.  There was also the puzzle hunt can that even happen anymore, a pretty major event that attracted supernerds from around the world, but was run by MIT undergraduates. Its just sad to think that MIT might permanently become a less colorful place if the campus stays closed.  In general, I worry that MIT is slowly becoming a more boring and generic university.  Even before COVID they cracked down on the hacking, and closed Senior House.  Two things that really helped make MIT feel unique.  I assume that the open campus made MIT students more humble.  I grew up in the Boston area, and my impression was that locals liked MIT students more than Harvard students.  They felt like they were less pretentious and stuck up.  This may have been because MIT was more inclusive of the public, or it might have been because MIT students were less isolated from regular people and were thus more comfortable interacting with them.  I wasnt an undergraduate so I cant confirm this, but Id imagine that a lot of the locals who hung out around MIT did so because they were interested in science, technology and engineering.  Their expertise might have been useful for whatever wacky, nerdy projects undergrads wanted to make happen.  Didnt Jaron Lanier loaf around MIT for like a year before he went and invented all the VR things  For what its worth, I never felt unsafe on MIT campus while it was open.  Id imagine that MIT campus is one of the safer parts of Cambridge, and Cambridge is a very safe city.  The campus was also never completely open.  Dorms, labs, and various study spaces still required key card access.  So there were still safe spaces.  And then a pragmatic pointthe TIM ticket system just adds a layer of complexity to things.  Every visitor, or caterer, or study participant, etc. needs to think about one more thing before they can access campus.  It takes up peoples time and headspace, and itll lead to hundreds of minor but annoying experiences.  So its not worth implementing, in my opinion, unless the net benefit is significant.  Finally, I dont think the COVID argument is relevant in the long term.  Even if it were a major health risk to reopen campus now which I disagree with, the risk level will probably recede to somewhere near preCOVID levels at some point in the near future.  So if you oppose reopening campus now, maybe think about whether youd still oppose reopening if COVID werent a factor.

However, since it is a graduate level course, it does require some level of mathematicalcoding maturity linear algebra, probability, calculus, is somewhat fastpaced, and expects you to learn a lot of the details of the material on your own.

One option might be to start in 6.100A, see the first assignment, and if it feels too fast, drop into 6.100L. Be aware that I dont know anything on how easyhard it is to adddrop when youre cross registered from Harvard.   If you dont plan on taking 6.100b, 6.100L is a more reasonable pace.

I minored in history though I was Course 22.", "I did extensive work designing minors related to course 6 while I was at MIT.   The primary benefits of minors that I identified for students are  1. Raising awareness of issues across disciplines 2. Providing credentialing  there are other benefits for society, though not so much for the Institute beyond a bit of signaling  setting up a new minor actually creates a burden on faculty   However, the credentialing benefit is moot if you have an MIT degree, let alone one in a technical area closely related to the minor. So the primary benefit is in providing a concise model curriculum for students to reference. In this sense, you neednt actually minor in anything, but just refer to the minor when exploring areas you want to study. I often found that my preconception of what was most important to know in an area of study differed from the reality. Talking to other students and professors, and referring to curricula designs, helped me realign myself.   So my overall recommendation would be to not officially minor in anything, especially if its closely related to your major, unless officially minoring gives you some other explicit benefit like access to something people not officially minoring dont get. Instead, just refer to the minor when deciding what to take. You will likely find that youre better served taking maybe 5075 of the subjects required for a minor, and using your time for something else, like a UROP or other classes outside the minor, or something else entirely.

I also remember vaguely Schrodinger being a minor part.  Amusingly, the year I took the Chem ASE before OCW materials were online and before the Internet was a thing, I was among the two who passed it, but my high school Honors Chemistry curriculum was pretty comparable to 5.11 plus we got into about a third to a half of 5.12, Organic Chemistry.", "A broader answer, but why do you want to pass the Chem ASE  5.111 is much much more material  difficulty than any APIB chem class out there however, if you lock yourself in your local library and do nothing but study 5.111 for the next month, youll probably be able to get an A on the practice finals and pass the ASE.  But is that good for your MIT career Would you consider being a ChemE or BioE or straight chembio Interested in Material Science or NuclearE If so, doing the 5.111 or even 5.112 class your first semester would be much more valuable and a better setup for your future classes.

Most of the remaining books seem to be completely unrelated to anything Id need in my work.  Novels, graphic novels, reading material that I could use although I never have... if I wanted to take a break, but they dont enhance the actual experience of working in any way.  The only section that has been improved, in my opinion, is the hallway that connects the library to the nonlibrary part of building 14.  Maybe most scientists and engineers dont care about these things.  Harvard downgraded their science library and as far as Im aware, only their science library in this manner, too.

It is a great and important choice for those less interested in the computer and more interested in how the computer interacts with its user and, just as importantly, the world around it.  To be fair, it is brand new and untested and could let me down in that respect. But from everything Ive read which is most of what has been released about it thats the hole it seems to be designed to fill.", "Hey, sorry to ask you this 2 months later, but Im curious to learn more about 64 as a senior thinking of applying to MIT. Do you think it can still provide the same amount of CS background as 64 if you take the right classes And is it generally designed to be a more society, ethics, and philosophy based major, or does it go into more of the technical aspects, such as coding AI Also, do you now know any other people who are going into 64 and also provide insight into what it may be like or how it is Im not sure if the MIT semester term has started yet, but if it has, Id also like to know how your classes are like so far. Thank you for your time", "Hi No worries One piece of advice Id give preliminarily is that these nuances really dont matter right now or even until around someones sophomore year at MIT. When looking at colleges I cannot emphasize enough how much more important the environment and culture are than the specifics of any major.  That being said 64 is still a very technical and CSoriented major. 63 requires at least intro classes to a lot of specialized fields you might enter as a programmer and 64 does not, but both will give a student a very strong set of programming skills. Both majors, for example, will teach you how to make AIML systems. 64 has some requirements that are more social based than technical such as AI, DataDriven Decision Making, and Society and has slightly more of an emphasis on ethics and society, but is absolutely not based on those tenentsI personally think MIT as a whole does not provide students with enough skills to consider how their technical skills and their applications might affect society. Im really liking 64 so far and am excited for the new courses available to me Though at the end of the day, in a lot of ways its similar to 63 and my life hasnt changed that much.  I hope that helps, but I seriously wouldnt worry too much about nuanced differences between majors at different schools. Applying to colleges is a stressful and scary process, but it at least is only asking you very general questions what approximate field do you want to enter, what kind of people do you want to livework with, where might be a nice place to live Im one random opinion, but I would absolutely suggest focusing on those", "Thank you so much for responding This was all really helpful information for me. Im glad youre enjoying your courses. Also, you are totally right with the advice haha. I think Im just focused on making sure I get exactly what I want out of college, but in the end that is less important than making sure I get into college in general.

I was wondering what past ASEers for Bio would recommend using to study in 2022. There are a lot of previous posts about this topic but ever since 2018 MIT added a new 7.016 course to OpenCourseWare taught by the two new professors Martin and Imperiali, which I have been using to study.   Previous threads have been hinting at the campbellreese book and also the 2004 MIT OCW lectures. Since these threads are now outdated, I was wondering if this opinion changes with this new OCW course MIT put up, especially in relation to the ASE.   Thanks for your guys help in advancedefinitely dont want to be studying the wrong stuff", "My knowledge might be outdated, but the 7.01x variants all basically start off the same biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology and then only differ in the last half or third. IIRC, the ASE mostly focuses on that core content, which also probably hasnt really changed that much Biology changes fast, but like, transcription still reads 35 and builds 53.. I would focus on those first subjects, and then if you have time a little recombinant DNA, neurobiology, and maybe immunology.", "Took it last year and iirc, there were a lot of genetics and recombinant DNA questions. That was also the content I thought was hardest.  I mostly studied by watching the 7.01SC videos and going through PSETsexams from the 7.01x classes. Thought AP Bio was pretty helpful tbh, although the ASE doesnt go into ecologyevolution. It focuses more on the biochemmolecular bio stuff, and again genetics and recombinant dna.  There were a few questions about immunology that I didnt study for, and tbh just guessedbsed my way through. Still passed though.  Good luck", "Thanks, this is super helpful. Does the ASE lack material in its entirety on topics such as recombinant DNA, neurobiology, and immunology Also, different 7.01x give either free response exams or a mix of MC and free response. Does the ASE cater to the ladder", "This is correct.", "I dont remember if it doesnt have anything on those parts, but remember that its just passfail, so you dont have to get 100. Id think if you had really solid mastery of the earlier sections, lets say there was one question on neuro and you had no clue, you could probably still pass overall even bombing one or two questions.

To preface, I dont really know much about how the internship  research position application process works in college  at MIT in particular.  I was wondering 1 how common it is for freshmen at MIT to do a UROP  internship the summer after their first year, 2 when the application season for internships is, 3 whether theres a general timeframe over which these internships tend to last or is it usually the entire summer, and 4 whether legit  popular summer internships are necessarily inperson.  Thanks for the help", "1 Its very common to do something your freshman year, but dont feel like youre a failure if you dont. Plenty of people chill at home or do something nonglamourous Your options are, generally internship, UROP, sports, summer program TA. And these are stackable my good friend did a UROP  was a summer program TA  2 Theres basically two application seasons for upperclassmen and one for underclassmen, though theres good intersect. The fall career fairs are generally geared to juniorsseniors so still go its amazing way to network and basically practice for underclassmen season, just dont feel bad if you dont get any fruits from your labor. The spring career fairs are gonna be more geared towards the last of the upperclassmen and also lots more internships.   Also other great ways to network is to be part of a club, engineering team, be a part of your majors mailing list, and just observe the flyers as you walk down the infinite  3 Its usually the entire summer but you can of course negotiate start  end times to give yourself a few weeks before andor after to be with familyfriends. Its very common to delay your start date.  4 Whats legit or popular mean to you If you mean the big tech stuff... at least before covid they were all in person but now its probably going to be one of the first things they clarify as you talk to a recruiter.  Overall dont stress too much, ask your freshman advisor and upperclassmen friends And dont treat UROPs as an afterthought when it comes to the summer their applications are just as hard  timely as internship applications.  EDIT Also MISTI Not sure how it works postcovid, but its super fun  Also you can use IAP to join a competition class like the poker challenge to network, and you can do hackathons to networks as well. Or you can even do an internship or UROP over IAP thatll set you up for a summer internship", "Good for you for thinking about it. Ill let a younger person answer.", "I think its pretty common to do a UROP pretty much any time after the first fall semester. So just make sure to make the deadlines to apply for a UROP on the UROP website. In terms of internships, those can pretty much happen whenever but summer internships are common and pretty available in Boston. In terms of length a lot of the ones Ive read in my field of interest have been 10 weeks but Im sure it varies. Good luck ", "What a perfect answer. The only thing Id add on the timeline is that it does vary a little by field. Application season for CSmeche tends to be in the fall and there are freshmen that find internships at fall career fair, but definitely dont feel bad if you dont because like they said its geared to upperclassmen. On the other hand, biotech internship season tends to be early in spring semester. I know course 20 has their own biotech career fair in late winterearly spring for that reason. Im not sure about some of the other fields, but it might be a good idea to discuss with someone in that area  Also  personally I did MISTI my freshman summer and would highly recommend it I went to Chile but there are a ton of different countries available  Also, this is offtopic but you should definitely check out tour de shass when they have it at the beginning of the school year. I feel like its not advertised enough and its really cool. Basically all the SHASS departments set up booths and give out thematic items and discuss their offerings for the upcoming year. Theres also usually free lunch", "I totally agree with all of this. Just to add on, Ive found that IAP micro internships often have a lower barrier for entry ofc depending on the company because its only a month long and it can easily lead to a summer internship offer. Also, the spring has Spring Career Fair and Xfair which I agree are definitely more approachable as a freshman I got my freshman internship at Xfair. There used to be a program called FASIP which was the freshman alumni summer internship program but unfortunately I believe it ended a few years ago. It was run by CAPD and I believe they still have freshmangeared events and workshops and I would definitely recommend those for preparing for interviews and creatingpolishing your resume.

I meant to explain myself more in my question.   I was curious if anyone had heard any actual data.   What happened to the kids who were at SH when it was shut down   Did anyone do an analysis of overall grad rate prepandemic to see if it went up after SH closed  Was there some kind of predictive modeling to tell who would have chosen senior house, where they ended up living after its closure, and what are they graduated  Thanks", "I doubt they followed up with the students. I echo everyone here in that the administration was clearly not really concerned about the students, but their image", "First, its important to understand that the worst of the statistics coming out of senior haus were at least a decade old at the time.  If your metric of evaluation is percent of students graduating within 6 years, this metric has a good deal of lag.  In my anecdotal experience, no  the closure probably hurt sixyear graduation rates.  And its no surprise that such a disruptive event would make it harder.  Making this case with data is tough because a its a relatively small number of students and b you need to have some prior guess at what the graduation rate should have been, based on the trends.    But more importantly, I think this question represents a fundamental misunderstanding about the administrations goals.  The administration did not care about helping its current students graduate.  They cared about the liability of having one dorm with a low graduation rate.  MIT cant be held responsible for a problem it cannot measure, and spreading students out so graduation cant be easily tracked solves their accounting problem.  Doing any kind of postclosure analysis would be counterproductive to their goals.", "Reif and his lackeys cannot leave fast enough.

One of them went on to become the first American ever to win the International Physics Olympiad, with the highest individual score.  The experience made me question myself.   E.g., I was very interested in physics, but being around them made think that I had nothing to contribute at all.  I decided not to become a physics major.  On the other had, the experience also forced me in a good way to find my own niche.   For me it was CS.  I could never compete with them on math  physics, but I could hold my own when it came to computers.

I believe she came in intending to major in math andor physics though so both of these were something she switched to.  I didnt major or minor in either field, but I did take a few literature classes while I was there and minored in Spanish which had some overlap.

It comes down to What do you want to do with your life  My story After undergrad, I went to work at Lincoln Lab. Kept taking classes, and decided I really wanted a PhD. When I finished, the internet was just beginning and it was pretty obviously going to be huge.  Academia looked interesting, but being a prof changed a lot from when I began undergrad to when I finished grad school. Most profs had transitioned to spending the majority of time raising money. To me, it looked like all of the work of founding a startup without much of the financial upside. I havent kept tabs on my prof friends, so I hope thats changed in the current environment.  So I landed at Bell Labs at Lucent All of the great fun of research without any of the fundraising. Then went and cofounded a startup. Met the VCs, raised 20M first round which was a lot of money in 2000.  My particular path would not have been possible without the PhD.

Sometimes a PhD opens doors entrepreneurially, but mostly results speak for themselves.  One thing I learned in my PhD is that you really have to have string intrinsic motivation to complete it. If your parents were one of driving factors for you going to grad school, its going to be hard for you to stay motivated when you hit a roadblock which honestly could last years. So I guess Id say that if you have a fairly well scoped thesis topic that youre confident about, you might be able to continue just regular hard work and get through it.

After all, that extra experience will only make you more valuable as a researcher, potentially give you some extra perspective, and you wont be constantly fighting the what if feeling throughout grad school.

Thats not necessarily the same thing as it being in your best interest, though. So dont feel bad about turning them down if youre not sure staying in this lab is absolutely the best way to accomplish your own personal goals.

More often they just realizedecide they would rather spend their life doing something more meaningful to them than research. It sounds like you already know something else is more meaningful to you than research...in which case, frankly, I would just invest the time you might have spent on the PhD, on that something else instead.

Additionally, the mandatory meal plan for frosh is now 225  meals per semester, which is really far more than anyone actually uses.   Newer facilities basically any of the Tier 1 housing will probably suit you. But if youre married to the idea of brand new, New Vassar was opened 2 years ago, Burton Connor will have just reopened after renovation, and New House was renovated in 2018. New Vassar and New House definitely have air conditioning I dont know if Burton Connor had it installed.  Suite style I only really know Simmons, where you share a bathroom with a maximum of 3 other people. There are some actual suites, but most of the clusters are open to the hallway. I think all other dorms have communal bathrooms, but I may be wrong.  Room size if you want to avoid triplesquads, you should probably avoid the dorms that have quads at all Maseeh, Baker. 4 dorms have up to triples Burton Connor, McCormick, Next, Simmons, and I dont think its super hard to get a double as a frosh in Simmons, although it depends on how the upperclassmen chose. I have no idea for the other dorms. If you want to 100 avoid a triple, East Campus, MacGregor, New House, New Vassar, and Random all only have singles and doubles.   Simmons design the Harry Potter elements are from our previous heads of house. Theres not actually a lot of elements. Also, be advised that if you wanted any kind of air conditioning, built in or inwindow, Simmons windows cannot accommodate inwindow air conditioners. Frankly, air conditioning isnt really all that crucial because its only desirable for maybe a couple weeks of each term. Also also, if you want the builtin friends that floor culture provides, Simmons may not be for you.

Next House shouldnt necessarily be lumped in with EC and Random. The most counterculture dorms are East Campus, Random, and Burton Connor before renovation it will probably remain there, but time will tell. Theres then a pretty large gap between them and SimmonsNext, which are probably the most alt of the West Campus dorms excluding BC of course. Also, Burton Connor and East Campus probably have the most famous parties on campus, as evidenced by the fact that I know about them and not any of other dorms I dont live in. Also also, New Vassar doesnt have a strongly established culture yet as far as I know.

You can also look at staying in an MIT frat over the summer not sure if youd be willing to consider this as an option, or if the frat housing is mostly full by now  Im too old to know what undergrad frats are doing.

We had a ton of fun with our summer boarders, would occasionally plan summer events beach trips, outings, social events within the house, and tried to include them in things if they were interested. We also had a ton of summer boarders who didnt want to be a part of anything either and they just kind of moved around as they saw fit. There is often a small population of the frats members staying there over the summer who help do a lot of the heavy lifting on the logistical parts of maintaining the house in exchange for not paying as much as a boarder, so you have locals you can ask questions to if you need help.

Even if it wasnt, I doubt I would have had better luck because ANY time a major website opens at a set time, it crashes. And therein lies the problem  accessibility. If accessibility isnt equal, then theres no form of equitable assignments.   If you cant make a website that can take thousands of simultaneous inputs that will fairly reward those who apply early based on time and not bandwidth and luck, then just do what everyone does and make it a multiround lottery to level the field.

Id be much more okay with requesting through a lottery and getting screwed by a random number generator than getting screwed by poor design on the part of the organizer.  Do better.

Im worried about the two year opportunity cost of attending grad school.

A small number of people pay their own way, depending on the field and department.  Most probably 8090 percent in engineering departments are connected up to a research project sponsored by the U.S. Government or an industrial partner.  The stipend is poor, but barely sufficient to live in Boston.  You will likely incur no additional debt.  The question is what is your goal  PhDs tend to end up being researchers or consultants in academia or industry, teaching andor conducting independent research.  You sound like you want a Masters degree, which can add to your qualifications for an industry position consulting or working on big engineering problems, and the degree will likely make you attractive to a new layer of companies doing exciting work, but maybe you already have that  Theres a few other second tier draws professors at MIT are very well connected in their field, which will open some more doors for you.  The research topic itself can be very interesting and you should look for a professors whose work excites you before even applying, but you will effectively only have a couple of years to work on that research topic unless you continue in a PhD program andor connect with the sponsor of the research or another organization also doing the same work and that can actually be frustrating to some people.  Every field is a bit different, and Im specifically working in one of the engineering departments, where what I type here holds most true.  You should do some homework to verify this in the field of your choice.    I cant emphasize this enough though if you get into a MS or PhD program at MIT look for the specific professors you think are doing what you want to study, find out as much as you can about them, and when you find a fit try to get into their specific labs as early as possible in the process.

Also skipping lectures, even if they seemed tedious, was detrimental to me. Going to every lecture helped keep me in a rhythm with school. I learned to start psets early, and ask during lecture about material i didnt understand in the pset. I guarantee most profs will know youve started your work early and theyll be eager to assist you when they see youre putting in the work early and trying to stay on top of things.   Also take everything everyone says about how hard a class is with a grain of salt. 2.005 and 2.006 for example were talked about as hard and grueling, but if you showed up to lecture, asked for help, and did the set reading they turned out to be some of my most memorable classes at MIT.

Causal reasoning can contribute to this process of interpretation and produce attitude reversals due to the network structure of beliefs. I will present the results of two vignette experiments, one based on the famous slogan of the car rental agency Avis Were No. 2that means we try harder, and the other based on online product reviews. When participants contextual beliefs about the economic environment are manipulated, message effectiveness changes as predicted by a Bayesian mechanism in which seemingly negative information is explained away in a more positive light, or vice versa. Thus, causal reasoning may help account for certain counterintuitive kinds of highlevel attitude change.  Speaker Biography Rahul Bhui is an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the MIT Sloan School of Management.  His research combines cognitive science, computational neuroscience, and behavioral economics to reveal the deep unifying principles that capture both rationality and irrationality. His work has been published in peerreviewed journals such as Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Nature Communications, Psychological Review, and Psychological Science, and featured in media outlets such as USA Today, the LA Times, and Scientific American.  Prior to joining the faculty at MIT, Rahul was Mind Brain Behavior Postdoctoral Fellow in the Departments of Psychology and Economics at Harvard University.

I still dont get what a union will do except making profs jobs even harder when securing funding for students and adding yet more administrative crap to sift through for everyone. I graduated less than 10 years ago and half my stipend went to rent. Whats the problem with that Grad housing was cheaper overall for my partner and I than living in the heart of Cambridge. MIT does however need to be fully transparent and release far more data to students than they currently do.     How about instead fire the useless admins and endless consultants MIT hires to cater and tip toe around every sensitive issue, and pay the students to come up with unique solutions to their problems. It seems every time I look at what is going on, MIT is just becoming more like any other decent engineering college. Theyre more concerned about their stupid USA Today rankings than actually producing highquality engineers who originally helped earn MIT their position in the world today.", "The price of on campus graduate housing has skyrocketed. Living in the heart of Cambridge is actually cheaper than staying on campus for me and results in a better quality apartment. We still dont have dental insurance included in our stipends or health insurance. Professors are allowed to abuse their graduate students with little recourse besides the student leaving their lab. They can threaten you on the basis of race, gender identity, etc and get away with it scot free if they have tenure. All of those outside consultants you mentioned MIT just hired them for lip service. They have no power to actually get help for people being abused or harassed under those policies. They exist so MIT can pretend they act on that stuff for visit weekends and to cover their asses. Some labs overwork their students. Im talking regular 80 hour weeks. I know for a fact that a certain PI over at the media lab admits students through themselves and almost exclusively picks international students. If they arent available to meet with them on 1 hour notice at 2 am on a weekday actual incident was 3 am btw Theyll threaten to kick them out of the lab and start calling people to get their visas revoked.   Just the dental insurance alone is worth a union, but there are so many other issues at stake. MIT is pushing a 5 raise to all the grad studentswhile increasing on campus rent by nearly 5 and ignoring the recommendation of 7.4 minimum to keep up with a rising cost of living. There are also very few resources if you happen to be a graduate student with a family. I get you attended here a long time ago, but either things are different or you just glazed over the worst parts of your experience because its been a decade. I talked to a guy who graduated from here in 2006. From the napkin math we did, MIT gave maybe 3040 worth of a subsidy on housing. Now Its closer to 10, maybe. Not to mention, thats if you can find housing. I know myself and many people who were stuck on and couldnt get off the waiting lists for our first year, meaning that wed have to keep competing for spots in the following years to even try to stay on campus.  MIT and the PIs working here take more than enough money into their labs as things stand. PIs wouldnt have to pay so much for us if MIT didnt charge them obscene tuition rates per semester, even for the semesters where we arent taking classes and just doing research which we already pay for by virtue of instrument use fees. The grad students here are already the cream of the crop, and yet other schools in cheaper areas pay and generally treat them a lot better. My first year offer from Princeton alone was over 10k greater than MITs Most schools are willing to cover the cost of moving or relocating, but again, not MIT. We deserve better.  EDIT oh, Id like to add many professors dont even do all the work of getting funding. I know multiple people whose PIs have taken up too many positions, so they hand off almost all grant writing work to them. As in they have their graduate student write practically the whole grant and submit it under their the PIs name. Sometimes theyll have multiple students cowrite them with each other, but those professors really dont do much in the way of getting funding themselves. They give talks and lord their 10 different jobs over people when they cant even put in the work for their first and most basic one.", "I guess your second paragraph seems in conflict with the first one. How do you think a large bureaucracy can be induced to downsize itself in favor of student salary The argument being made by the unionization folks is that collective bargaining is the way to get the institution to make changes, like shifting resources to students by debloating administration. If the pool of funding is fixed, and stipends rise, thats exactly whats going to have to happen. I dont want anyone to lose their jobs, but endless administration isnt in and of itself a productive enterprise. It just tends to make work for itself. So I entirely agree with you there.", "What a woefully out of touch comment   Your first paragraph....smfh", "Hey Im joining media lab this fall, a bit scared by what you said. What is the abbreviation of the group I hope Im not in that group...", " The price of on campus graduate housing has skyrocketed.  I lived in Edgerton House when rent was 1800mo for a single. My stipend then was about 2800mo. It was tight, but i was able to get by and no worries. My job was to graduate and get out of graduate school so i could start a real life. Being a graduate student is not a career, its a means to an end. Get your degree and move on as quickly as you can.   Edgerton 1br  2200, doctoral stipend is 3400. The differential, at least for me is approximately the same with inflation at the moment. So i call bullshit on skyrocketing rates. My source for rental rateshttpsstudentlife.mit.edugradhousingrates and my source for graduate stipendshttpsgradadmissions.mit.educostsfundingstipendrates.   Dental insurance i can agree with, and that should be part of the health insurance waiver. That said dental insurance is 45mohttpsmedical.mit.edugsdp which is incredibly cheap. That said, i do agree it should just be tacked onto the health insurance policy and done away with as a separate item.   Professors are allowed to abuse their graduate students with little recourse besides the student leaving their lab.   I call bullshit as all a student has to do is record actual abusive behavior and itll put any faculty into hot water, particularly when its blackmail regarding a student visa. This doesnt need a union to solve the problem, students just need to know theyre not helpless and can speak up.   I do agree that graduate housing is far too limited regarding the number of students and lack of practical housing when compared to Cambridge rent prices. Trim the fat from useless admins, and leave professors alone.    MIT and the PIs working here take more than enough money into their labs as things stand.   MIT may, but academic money is drying up quite fast compared to previous years, so no profs are not swimming in money. Not sure where you got that idea from. MITs overall overhead is a significantly greater portion of its endowment because of all the labs they are running  Where are you getting your numbers for princetonhttpswww.princeton.edunews20220125princetonwillsignificantlyincreasestipendssupportgraduatestudents these are comparable graduate rates to MIT.     oh, Id like to add many professors dont even do all the work of getting funding. I know multiple people whose PIs have taken up too many positions, so they hand off almost all grant writing work to them.  I was given this sort of work to do. Its called being an academic and is excellent training for people who want to go into academia. What better time to learn how to write grants than in graduate school Youre at MIT, not a middletier research institute. Put on your big kid pants, and get to work. If you want to parade yourself around as having earned a degree from the top engineering school in the world, then work like you earned it. As someone who graduated recently having gone through MIT from undergrad through 2 graduate degrees, I am incredibly thankful my PI pushed me hard in graduate school. I am singled out and put on the spot often because of where I earned my degrees. People outside of MIT expect a certain level of initiative and excellence from MIT graduates, and that bar gets raised even higher for PhDs.    I agree with stopping abusive PIs from doing inappropriate things, but PIs who push their students hard is just a natural part of being at MIT. You want that worldclass degree that commands a lot of respect You need to put in the grinding work to earn it.", "Fighting large bureaucracy with another layer bureaucracy   But the neat part is it wont downsize itself regardless. There will be just another army of bureaucrats to deal with union issues. So the pool of funding is now paying for bureaucrat of the union and the bureaucrat to deal with union. Student salary might rise in pennies but the lost of otherwise available positionsfunding opportunities will much larger due to cost of additional two layers of bureaucracy.", "Hey sorry this is so late, but i think its important to keep discussing this even though folks voted for unionizing it seems.  The large bureaucracy can be downsized by alums not giving as much money to the institute, as well as faculty quality dropping. This is already happening. This is anecdotally within engineering, but many of the best engineering students in my graduate time have left for industry because it pays so much better and there is so much less bureaucracyconcern for being sensitive to anythingeverything.   Expanding on my first point Being a graduate student is temporary. So many other graduate schools require students to go into debt to attend. You are literally being supplied with free tuition and money to live. The net contribution for stipend  tuition is what, 150kyear with overhead Cambridge rent is rediculous, so of course youll lose out on a significant chunk of the stipend to rent. If folks cant afford foodtravel thats one thing, but if people are able to eat, sleep, and afford some activities, things do not need to change regarding stipends. Again, this is a temporary situation while you get a degree from a worldclass institution that will let you leverage HUGE amounts of cash after school.   I wasnt in grad school too long ago and i never felt a tight pinch with the stipendliving in MIT housing, so i find it incredulous that students are up in arms over it. Where are their funds going   Im all for protecting students from abusive PIs, but i think far too much blame is being placed on professors. Apply enough pressure, and the overall quality of the institute is going to drop. MIT is not supposed to be a comfortable safe place. Its meant to push you, and mold you into a harddriving topoftheline professional who can take people getting in your face. Else its just like any other college and we shouldnt consider it anything special, because its quickly running out of material to differentiate itself from other schools. I cannot express to you how many times ive been under a microscope more often than others simply because of my graduate school, and Im glad quals for example were as stressful and demanding as they were because they actually prepared me for the harsh reality outside of MIT.", "I was told this just before I got a pretty nasty concussion thats had me out of commission.

They are bringing in an organization that already exists to help gain collective power. So the first part of your claim makes no sense. The claim that negotiating with a union causes more bureaucracy doesnt make much sense either. You do these contract negotiations to cover a multiyear period. Whatever extra burden there is during negotiations is not ongoing. Sounds a lot like youre talking out of your ass.", "Ok my lab is a he, and didnt look like mostly international students, so maybe Im ok. Will check with lab mates thanks", "A large union that already exist, the same way that MIT admins already exist How does that negates the point that both are bureaucrats   You realize that you have to pay that existing union from your salary, which draws from the fixed pool of funding And have to follow various union policies and businesses, many are quite disruptive, not to mention contributing a large amount of due toward larger union organization. All of them are ongoing.   MIT themselves have to pay for various specialized bureaucrats to negotiate with union bureaucrats and deal with whatever issues arise, also from the same pool of funding.  Dont react like I am insulting your god just because I point out the obvious. If you can remain on point, please do.", "You realize that you have to pay that existing union from your salary, which draws from the fixed pool of funding And have to follow various union policies and businesses, many are quite disruptive, not to mention contributing a large amount of due toward larger union organization. All of them are ongoing.    our salaries that will go up a lot higher than they would if we continued letting MIT ignore the recommendations for increased CoLinflation.   union dues, once benefits  pay increases are covered, almost always pay for themselves and then some. also, please describe some of these policies and how theyre disruptive.  and am I supposed to feel bad about MIT paying more its not like theyre anywhere near stretched thin or poor. graduate students are not paid from a fixed pool of funding generally. our advisors pay us from THEIR funding, which MIT already takes out about as much as we earn a year from for tuition, even when we arent taking actual classes.", "Its a simple math, our salary and all other institutional expense are coming out from the same funding pot. But now, due to added layered of bureaucrats, union in the form of your due and MIT specialist dealing with union, there is less money over left for our salary and other institutional expense.   Meaning, for every pennies student salary increases you get, there will less for available positionsfunding opportunities for other prospective students, plus the loss cost to union and MIT added bureaucrat.   Advisors are MIT employees, there is no THEIR funding, both legally and practically. It is all MIT money, and it is limited. And the same logic apply. Union mean more of their THEIR funding will get wasted on union fee and MIT bureaucrats dealing with union, and less for actual researchesstudiespositionopportunity, but at least you get some.  About how some of these policies or how disruptive, take a strike that can last for months or years, will suspend most learning and research activities, even if you dont agree to any of that. For every issue, interaction between you and your advisorinstitution, there is now another layer of union and MIT union specialist. Equally important, you are forced to belong to, represented by an organization that you dont consent to.  You dont need to feel bad about anything or anyone, but hostile denial of such basic thing is just disingenuous.", "Its a simple math, our salary and all other institutional expense are coming out from the same funding pot. But now, due to added layered of bureaucrats, union in the form of your due and MIT specialist dealing with union, there is less money over left for our salary and other institutional expense.    Do you know how graduate students are paid Our PIs get grant money. They give grant money to the institute just to pay to be there. They then pay out of the remainder of the grant money to us. If they cant afford us, they cant take on new grad students. It is not from the same pot. Even across departmental funding sources, like TAships, that money is allocated and sourced from completely different areas on a department by department basis. The money goes to their accounts that only they and people listed on the accounts can take money from. If what youre saying is true, advisors would never ever have the problem of not having enough funding to cover a new student not just projectwise, but stipendwise. each student is 100k each year in grant money being spent. The money is MITs, but MIT does not just take the money a lab gets in from grants, pools it, and distributes it across the school or even a department And I dont understand the misconception that MIT is even remotely hurting for money and would have to cut things to pay for the relatively small expenses of a union besides benefits that graduate students deserve for carrying the institute on their collective back.  About how some of these policies or how disruptive, take a strike that can last for months or years, will suspend most learning and research activities, even if you dont agree to any of that.  Again, good. If something is problematic enough that we strike for it there is no way MIT would let it go on for years, they would sooner fall in and address it, its worth it. A strike is not something you do because 1 advisor told somone to email them something ASAP past midnight. Take a look at Harvard, which has a grad student union, too. Their strikes have been about fair pay, acting to stop discriminationbigotry, and other serious problems. And most importantly, strikes are voted on by the people striking. I will have a voice, but if Im in the minority, Im fine standing in solidarity with my fellow graduate students.  For every issue, interaction between you and your advisorinstitution, there is now another layer of union and MIT union specialist.   Good. My advisor is great, but some of my friends have had advisors that have even discriminated against and harassed them on the basis of who they were, and they had no option but to leave the lab. MIT would not get the advisor to stop the problem behavior and would not punish them, diversity representative or no, threats to their physical wellbeing be damned. The union wont intercede if youre talking with your advisor about deadlines, draft edits or research plans despite MITs attempts to represent it like that. Itll intercede if your advisor consistently gives the only minority in the lab more shit or worse opportunities than everyone else. Or if your advisor doesnt respect the basic human rights of one of their students who came out recently. Or if your advisor is the kind of person to yell and shout terrible things at you during group or 1 on 1 meetings. I know enough people that have been in those situations that even if I have some extra work injected in my good interactions with my great advisor, I dont mind. The slight inconvenience to me could make a world of difference to someone who is in a much worse situation, and I think thats fine.", "They give grant money to the institute just to pay to be there. They then pay out of the remainder of the grant money to us. If they cant afford us, they cant take on new grad students.  Precisely, when the MIT get additional expense for specialist just to deal with union, they will take more from the income, in this case both PI grant and student tuition. And with PIs have less money left and also pay more for each graduate student and pay for union due, they simply have to cut back position, funding, equipment, hire etc. All MIT revenue and expense is of the same pool, and MIT will move money around to cover increased expense. Its basic finance.  And I dont understand the misconception that MIT is even remotely hurting for money and would have to cut things to pay for the relatively small expenses of a union besides benefits that graduate students deserve for carrying the institute on their collective back.  What you call a misconception is just basic fact. The money for you and union fees and admins fees in response to union are at the expense of someone else.  Again, good. If something is problematic enough that we strike for it there is no way MIT would let it go on for years, they would sooner fall in and address it, its worth it.  Good for whom Really, who are you to make such judgement for anyone else Who are you to say that its worth it so that everyone will have to accept no matter if they agree with or consent to or not  I will have a voice, but if Im in the minority, Im fine standing in solidarity with my fellow graduate students.  Do you always force anyone in the minority to accept whatever decided for them by the majority Just stay shut and stand in for solidarity, that how you want to be treat as minority OK, but then again, why do you want to compel this conformity attitude on all minority I get that being forced to belong, to be represented by an organization you dont consent to is part of union life.

The slight inconvenience to me could make a world of difference to someone who is in a much worse situation, and I think thats fine.  You believe union would be helpful or effective in those cases, good for you. I dont have the same delusion. In all seriousness, I will find and use of representative that I actually choose and trust to act on my behalf, not something that being forced on me and represent me by default.

I ask the professors and TAs how Im supposed to be able to solve these, and they say I should just practice longer. Im skeptical of this because Ive struggled on problems before and gotten the right, but when I move onto another novel problem, I dont automatically know what to do. Working longer on the problems doesnt make me feel more confident about my ability to solve a variety of them. This is why on study guides, I usually spend most of my time reading the solutions, so I have something similar to connect to when doing new problems. Has anyone else done this or felt the same, but then they were proven wrong when they started working longer on the problems", "Right. MIT classes dont test your ability to cram and regurgitate, they test how well youve actually learned the material and can apply what you know to new problems. As you do psets and study for tests, you have to make sure that youre actually understanding the concepts and not just the particular methods to solve the particular problems youre faced.", "From personal experience, it was less about the raw amount of time, but just that I could only absorb so much material in a given timeframe. The amount of material and information you need to do well at MIT is just drastically more than what you typically see in high school.   This lead to my high school studying habits cramming for a PSET or studying for exams the day prior or even a few days prior being insufficient for MIT. It was a learning lesson for myself to have to start preparing and studying weeks out in advance of a PSET due dateexam. 2 hours a day for 23 weeks was more effective for myself than 3 days of 12 hour studying.   Cramming leads to repetition, whereas spaced out studying actually helped me internalize and understand the material which as others have stated, is critical to doing well on exams at MIT", "I was at MIT for grad school so this might not be as relevant as I never took those courses, but I felt the same especially in physics and proofbased math classes it felt like every problem was new and none of the practice problems prepared me for it.   I will say that there are a lot of studies on learning that show that this is common for novices, and experts are better able to sort problems and see the similarities. The teachers probably do think that the test questions are very similar to the psets, even if it might not appear to be similar to you.   This is something that working through many different problems could help with not just spending more time on a handful of problems so eventually you might have seen ones closer to what shows up on the test. Thats what helped me in undergrad with physics I remember the night before a test doing a practice test and feeing like I didnt know how to do anything, but then on the test feeling like every question was basically the same as the practice test and now I knew what to do. For the proofbased pure math classes, I never did figure out how to prepare for those tests and so once required classes were out of the way shifted towards more applied classes. Interestingly, my husband also went to the same college and took the same classes with the same teachers, and his recollection of these math classes is that the tests were very similar to the homework in the approaches he used. So thats the difference between someone who really understands the material and someone like me who did only at a very superficial level.   Another approach might be to take a more metacognitive approach and book some time with your TA to go through some psets together and ask them which problems are the same, and whats similar in their  approach to take on a few of the problems that dont seem the same to you but are considered the same category to them.

I know this question has been posted here a few times. I have read all the posts in here regarding housing, but I am still a bit undecided about how to rankwhat my preferences are.  I am an incoming PhD student, starting Fall 2022. I will only be living oncampus for the first year. I am married but my spouse will not be living with me the first year. However, I am still considering the couples housing that way when he visits me he can stay for long periods of time if he wanted to. I might end up putting a combination of single and couples housing in my ranking hopefully that is allowed...  I am considering the following ranked in terms of current preference  1. Westgate   efficiency for couples 1,641  I like that its not furnished since I can bring in a real bed with me     how comfortable are the beds in the furnished rooms   it also seems to have a regular sized fridge which I think is nice     2. Warehouse   efficiency 1,745   this one is not for couples, but I like that the beds they provide are bigger and the rooms look nice     3. SidPac   efficiency for couples 1,745  can two people reasonably sleep in this small of a bed XL twin bed   the efficiency in Ashdown House is the same price as this one but doesnt accommodate couples so I think I might as well put sidpac instead of Ashdown...   Edgerton and the 70 Amherst St. 1br apartments would be in my list if they werent expensive, but they are out of my preferred budget range  if these are absolutely worth it, I might consider them  Lastly, I am super tempted to suck it up and request a single or large single room in 70 Amherst St. The price is very tempting, 928 for the single and 1,103 for the large single. This would allow me to save and pay down my debt by a LOT. My biggest concern is not having a kitchen in the room. Does anyone have experience using the communal kitchen How crowded does it get Can you use it any timeis it open 247 Is there an eating area or do students normally eat in their rooms I barely eat out, so I cook almost all of my meals. I saw a picture of the communal kitchen on their website and it looks alright. Is there enough space in the room to have a mini fridge Has anyone lived in one of these rooms in Amherst Is it worth it Would you recommend it Again, it would only be for the first year.    Communityevents within each building are not extremely important to me, they are a plus but will not affect my ranking. What influences my preferences the most are price and cleanliness of the building. The location is not super important either, I looked where all the buildings are located and they all seem to be in good spots...   I appreciate any insight and suggestions Thank you", "FYI regarding housing in Westgate and the 70 Amherst 1bedroom according to MITs housing site Family housing is available only to fullyregistered MIT students and current MIT Affiliates who live with their familiespartners full time and meet all eligibility requirements. If your familypartner lives elsewhere but only comes to visit for a few weeks or months of the year, you are not eligible for family housing.  I believe you would still qualify for the other options you listed.", "I lived in 70 Amherst my first year in a small single. Communal kitchen can be hit or miss. There are large spacious ones and small cramped ones. Depending on ur room assignment you may be close or far. Each kitchen has cabinets that you can lock your things in, but the fridge is totally open access. The smaller kitchens were often problematic since people would leave a mess. The communal bathrooms were actually kept fairly clean. I kept a mini fridge in my room as well as a microwave. The rooms are small but the proximity to campus is nice if thats important to you.   By far the worst part is the absolute lack of food, groceries, and entertainment in the Kendal square area. The closest market is brothers and is overpriced.   The absolute best part aside from low cost was being right on the river. The sailing pavilion is right near the dorm so its very easy to take advantage of it. Also it is next to the campus bar.   70 amherst is a great way to save money but it comes at a great cost its a dorm not an apartment. 70 Amherst was an undergraduate dorm and the only change since they made it a graduate dorm is that theyve painted over some of the pornographic murals. Would I do it the same if I could do it all over again Yes.  Also, Ive been told by friends who live in singles in other dorms sidpac that on campus singles are cheaper than almost anything you will find within a reasonable distance from campus off the red line. But living with roommates off campus is cheaper than with roommates on campus. Personally, I recommend living in Porter square or Davis square, in my four years here Ive lived in both. The green line is also being extended into north Somerville which may make commuting from more affordable areas easier. Typically the further from the red line the cheaper.  There is a HarvardMIT housing page on Facebook you should look into. It can sometimes save you from having to pay brokers fees.", "Fwiw, it used to be reasonably common for people in sp to not want their twin maybe they wanted to buy a queen or something, and then theyd loan it to someone else in sp to use for the year to push together with their own to make a king. So you could potentially either borrow a 2nd bed or loan yours out to replace with a queen or something.", "I am also an incoming PhD student, who is starting this fall and looking for housing.

Ive lived here for my entire phd so far currently in a one bedroom with my partner and also liked the fact that I could bring my own bed and have real furniture. Also, I have had members of my family come to visit for a week at a time and have never had issues with the guest policy in that regard.", "Ah, thanks.. so they can stay with me for a few weeks or a month if they wanted to in the singles housing not sure if they are strict about guests", "Thank you This is exactly what I wanted to learn about 70 Amherst. Thanks for the insight about the kitchens it sounds like there are different depending on the floorside of building If I do end up in one of the rooms there, I would probably get a mini fridge and microwave as well.   It does look like the most dormlike of them all, but that price is hard to beat. I think it wouldnt be too bad for a yr, again, considering I could aggressively pay down some of my debt and continue putting some of my sad grad income to work.   I visited campus last week and did think the location of this building was quite nice.   Most of what Ive found for off campus for a studio and close to the red line seems to start around 1,800 and would probably have to add utilities to that. Ive been checking out that FB page and might consider  theres some good deals on there but mostly for living with roomates  x200B  Thanks again", "omg thanks for writing about this. I didnt know you could take out the twin and bring in your own ..... i have never lived on campusdorm so no idea how the whole thing works lol   Thanks", "i know, from what ive seen on campus looks a bit more expensive for what you get...   a few reasons I am still thinking on campus   will be arriving to MA as late as possible early Sept due to finishing another degree at the moment, so this way I do not have to worry about looking for housing   will only be in Cambridge for the first year, then moving far reason not important   I do not have a lot of money saved. In my experience with renting they usually ask for first month, last month, background check fees, application fee, etc. and I dont have money for that right now     Wouldnt have to worry about paying for utilities   I am leaving my car at my current state during the first yr so rather be really close to campus   If I end up requesting a large room in Amherst, I dont think anything off campus will beat that price  particularly because I dont want roommates    x200B  That  being said, I continue to look at off campus options every now and then. If I find something close to the T and with a decent price I might consider, but not sure if there will be options with no roommates, cheaper price, and no movein fees.   But then again Ive never lived in MA nor oncampus anywhere so open to hearing what people think about this.", "Edgerton does looks nice and I could technically afford it but I am not convinced the prices are worth it for an oncampus accommodation. for next yr it says 1,869 for efficiency and 2,212 for 1br at edgerton.... will think about it. thanks", "Technically, no.

In undergrad when people stayed at their bfgfs dorm theyd always cram into a twin bed, but now that Im older there would be no way For me I was used to a futon so it was fine. When one of my suite mates moved out they gave me their mattress topper. You could always buy a memory foam topper, if thats the kind of thing that helps. The dorms all have different amenitiesculture a little bit, it seems a shame to avoid one just for the bed, since you could surely  find a way to buy your own and make room", "That makes sense  Yeah definitely the bed wouldnt scare me away now from some of the options knowing i could just swap it out for my own.

One thing that all alumni say is that everything after MIT undergrad, be it a job, a PhD, or anything else, is literally a walk in the park.   However, its not like it isnt rewarding. You see yourself grow so much. Classes get progressively harder, but you become progressively better at handling them. Freshman PNR is there to ease you in, and you have to choose which way you want to roll. If youre happy with a C, you could have a pretty chill time. If youre aiming for an A, its going to be a constant grind.   Sometimes I feel like if Id gone to another school, I wouldnt have to cope with so much stress and anxiety, and I would have a much better social life. But Im honestly happy Im at MIT because I really dont care about the college experience. Thats not why Im here I came here to become an engineer, and thats what Im focused on. Its just 4 years of my life, Ive made friends, Ive met amazing people, and I have no regrets.   The people who are struggling the most, I feel like, are the ones who put academics second. You have to be motivated to go through the struggle earning a C at MIT is hard. Earning an A isnt impossible, but its way more work than you could expect. People who do well here are the ones who put in the most work, honestly. Even if there are people who are doing better because they are more experienced, you can get there with enough time and effort. The question is, are you willing toable to put that much time and effort in.  Edit typos", "I hated the experience, but I never regretted attending  its all for that diploma", "The IHTFP culture is such a bonding experience though. I actually loved it, even though it was stressful.  And yes I had time for hanging out with friends I played a varsity sport which is already a couple hours at least everyday and going to parties.  My grades couldve been better but I never failed any exams or classes, and Im far from a genius. I feel like I just stumbled into MIT because I liked math just whatever I learned in class, I wasnt a mathlete and thought physics was neat.", "Doing my masters. No fancy academic background.  Youll get used to the workload in 23 weeks. Its contingent on your aptitudepassion for the course though", "Lol Im failing chem here right now. But the rest is manageable. Join ESG your freshman year, the tiny class sizes are amazing and the professors are nice.", "My son came from a public school that hadnt had a T10 admission for like 7 years. Not that it was horribly underfunded or anything but he sure wasnt getting chemistry labs in biology Labs like a kid at a elite New York high school or Exeter or something.  He said there was a leap for him to make his very first semester. However he passed everything quite easily. They dont give you actual grades your first freshman semester, so thats good for you to think on. But you can of course figure your grade yourself, and he got all As.  Once again, admitted from a public high school in the midwest, started from a deficit but still got all As his first semester.  The only caveat I have for you is that he has said that he finds it very difficult to have any time to join a club or group or anything like that.   He did a little bit of some sport on Saturday mornings last semester.   This semester hes doing something back home so he has actually been back in the Midwest for 3 day weekends two separate times since this semester started and hes still keeping up just fine.", "Im a frosh and MIT is hard but its doable. IMO its also an environment where you get out what you put in. You can choose to give yourself a lighter workload or overload yourself with commitments. I didnt do olympiads either and I like to think Im challenging myself with my course load and UROP and extracurriculars and yeah while it is stressful and I often feel hosed or sacrifice sleep, at the end of the day I can get the work done and am able to make time to hang out with people, take a walk, go to a party every week, etc. You have to be prepared to crank up work ethic but its not impossible. I think it is def work hard play hard and maybe I enjoy the pain lol but in the end its also rewarding. You should come to CPW and feel it out for yourself too", "mmm I like it here. I usually take the standard load of 48 units so four classes or less and I also came in without academic competitions or whatever.  sometimes its easy for some folks to fall in the trap of in my opinion taking too much schoolwork, but i think the daytoday will be or become manageable or even pleasant for most everybody whos accepted.  MIT also puts a lot into slowly adjusting frosh to the schoolwork. first semester is on PNR passno record, basically no final grades on transcript and second semester is ABCNR, so no risk of Fs. the GIRs are also partially about easing you into things.", "Current frosh here. I dont think the workload here is actually worse than at other colleges Unless youre really taking advantage of not having a credit limit after freshman year. Some classes may be more difficult than their counterparts at other colleges, but if thats the case, you just learn more. I also think that this aspect of MIT is somewhat exaggerated because people who are overworked are going to be more vocal than people who arent. Personally Im not particularly social and Im not interested in parties, but if I wanted to, Id definitely have the time to party and hang out with friends decently often.  Also, I dont come from an olympiad background and Im a prospective math major, and I havent felt that Im at a disadvantage in any significant way.", "I worked solid seventy to eighty hour weeks while doing my masters at Sloan. Worth it.", "MIT has a reputation  both to outsiders and oncampus  of having a terrible workload, too much stress, etc. To be honest, I think a lot of it is overblown.   First, the IHTFP culture can be toxic in that it pressures people to be busy and suffering, often for no good reason. If you arent constantly hosed, you should feel bad about not doing enough. If you do well on an exam, you should shut up about it, even though statistically MIT students do quite well on most exams. Fortunately, getting out of this vicious cycle is a personal choice, one that I see more and more of my friends taking. You dont have to take seven classes just because your genius math olympiad friend is taking eight. You dont have to join a bunch of clubs just so your resume will look good in three years. Once you realize how amazing an environment MIT is without all of the baggage, you wont have any second thoughts about those other schools.  The grade deflation is bad relative to e.g. Harvard, but it is humbling and helps you to grow  you stop worrying about getting straight As or whatever standard you had for yourself in high school, and instead take classes for the sake of learning. Classes are hard by design, but for the most part, the more you put into it, the more you get out of it. If everyone could keep up with all the classes, what would be the challenge I want to refer you to thishttpsmitadmissions.orgblogsentrysurvivingmit MIT admissions post. I know a lot of them can be cheesy and overthetop but this one is worth reading before coming to campus.  There is definitely time to go to parties and hang out with friends on a regular basis. The MIT fraternities are the heart of Bostons university party scene every weekend. Even if youre not into that, MIT is ideally placed, close to Cambridge, Allston, and of course Boston. Go out and explore, eat great food, meet awesome people  do whatever fun things you want, because thats what college is about. MIT doesnt preclude you from having a good experience, it just simultaneously enhances that experience with a good dosage of intensity and nerdiness. And if you come to CPW, youll see firsthand what I mean  BTW feel free to dm, Im a current 23 studying 18 and 63.", "Sophomore here.  This place is so hard but it is also 100 manageable. You dont have to be a genius, but if you ask for help, start early, and go to your classesoffice hours you will get through. Also want to emphasize you DO NOT need Olympiad background or anything like that. Ive also learned to stop expecting As and to expect low scores on exams, but it depends on how much work you do. You can have A LOT of free time and still learn so much in your classes.  x200B  You can definitely hangout with friends multiple times a week or go to a party once a week. It is sometimes hard to plan things since people are so busy but any night you will be able to find friends willing to hangout, dont think its all work no socializing ", "What this comment said about the college experience is right on. Speaking with my son who is a freshman, I dont see him getting the typical college experience like his older siblings do.   He said there wasnt enough time for him to join groups or clubs per se. At least not yet.

How many courses do you all suggest to take to maintain a healthy mental health while getting all out of the MIT experience Im looking to double major and I dont knock out my general requirements until sophomore spring based on my roadmap. Im thinking to perhaps take more courses but Im afraid it will tank on my mental health and other social activities. What are you guys advice on that  Thank you", "My general advice is to not double major.  With maybe a few exceptions, double majoring can be really limiting, and Im not sure if the benefits are really worth it.  And its not as if you either double major in a subject or take no courses.  You can do things like, take a lot of the courses required for the major but just not all.  But I think especially at a place like MIT where there are a lot of cool and interesting classes to take, its nice to have the ability to be flexible.", "Four classes is standard. Dont exceed that until you get used to MIT, and then only if you really need to.  Dont double major unless theres a very specific thing you want to do that genuinely requires those academic credentials. Otherwise its a ton more work and all you get is some extra words on a piece of paper. The piece of paper and where its from matters, what exactly it says doesnt.  If you dont double major, theres plenty of time to complete a major with 4 or even fewer classes per term. And then MIT can be a fun and only occasionally soulcrushing place, as opposed to destroying you continuously for four or more years.", "1. Depends on how in depth your AP class was, and how standard your ASE is. For instance, when I took the bio ASE, they had a lot of gene transfer questions, and I didnt know how to do those, whereas the sample ASE I took seemed more in line with my AP knowledge. People at least a few years ago used to talk about how the chem ASE was so so difficult, even though the majority of the questions were within the breadth of AP content, and I think a lot of it was because that ASE always covered crystal field theory, which isnt a topic taught in AP.  2. Well, thats up for you to find out. The first semester is PNR, and that will allow you to figure out how many classes you can take without sacrificing other aspects of your life. People say four is standard, but the specific classes you choose really affect how that goes. Ive taken between 3.5 and 7, and they sucked in different ways. Also, you dont have to take all your GIRs in freshman fall. You can take a few GIRs but also try out some intro major requirements to get a taste of if thats what you want to do.", "Try 4 and see how you feel. Note that project and lab classes will try to eat your life in ways that normal classes wont.", "hi current 25 student here. I ASEd 6.0001 and 18.01 had transfer credit for 18.02 and 18.06.   for 18.01, I pretty much forgot most of BC calc because I took it my sophomore year of high school. I went through all of Khan Academys course on it and that was more than enough for me.  for 6.0001 not sure if you care, I took AP CSA in my sophomore year as well and I did some codeacademy  codingbats to teach myself python. I definitely barely passed that ASE by the skin of my teeth but it wasnt terrible.  for bio and chem, look at old finalspractice examsASEs if you can. theyre not too similar to AP classes, whereas 18.01 and 8.01 definitely are.   as for courses, Im only on my second semester, but 4 is definitely enough. look into your double major and see if you 1 really need to doing a major and minor will probably get you what youre looking for and 2 if it actually requires you to take more than 4 maybe 5 sometimes classes. regardless I think theres like an 80 chance that by the time you get here, your decision on your major is going to change, and its going to keep changing while youre here. dont stress  no matter what, youre going to get out of here with a degree from MIT and an incredible education and most of all, an incredible experience. that is, if you make sure you make the most of it rather than taking unnecessary classes and overworking yourself.   feel free to pm me if you have anymore questions", "Mental health based questions are different for everyone. 4 classes is standard. I have a couple friends who typically take around five. Honestly most semesters I take 3 and I think Id be way more burnt out by nowsenior if I had pushed myself to do more at a time. The move here is to figure out what does and does not work for you and to not think too hard about what the typical course load is.", "Current 25 student here, can give some advice about ASEs. I took the ASE for the 6 courses below, and failed chem. OCW  OpenCourseWare  18.01   I would say that AP Calculus BC is enough to pass this ASE, and maybe you could look at the OCW as well to get a refresher as to what topicsproblems will be on the exam.  18.02  mainly used the OCW to prepare for this course, I would say that the OCW problems are a good representation of the exam.  8.02  I would say the OCW is pretty decent, although nowhere near the difficulty of the actual exam. The 8.02 course on edX is pretty good, and  Im pretty sure theyre lenient with the grading for this one. If youve taken AP Physics C EM, most of the exam content is covered in the AP course, but you might want to look at some stuff about waves.  5.111  dear god i bombed this test i think only studying the 5.111 OCW isnt enough, would recommend looking at the 5.112 OCW maybe if you want to pass it. AP chem is not enough  7.012  I prepared for this using the edX course with Eric Lander hes a really good teacher. I think that the OCW is not that good video quality is pretty bad and if you really want to study using OCW, maybe try looking at 7.016 OCW. I also looked at Campbell a bit. I didnt take AP Bio in high school, but I heard from others that the content of this ASE is pretty different from what AP Bio covers.  6.0001  this ASE wasnt too bad, but I did some coding in high school in AP CSA. Its definitely possible to teach yourself Python in the few weeks before. Also, I think the 6.0001 people give practice problems on MITx. Idk really what I did to prepare for this, but i just went through the videos on MITx or edX, i forgot did some practice problems and that was it", "What is an ASE Also, Ive done like zero research on MIT never thought Id get in, so Im not sure where I should start with my planning.

I know that time will tell how much I get in needbased aid, but Im a little hesitant to celebrate my acceptance when Im not sure if itll be possible for me to go.  So my question is, what are the chances that I get good financial aid Obviously no one can know for sure, but for reference, my EFC is 7800. I got into UVA also, where the total cost of attending was 70k, and I was granted 35k in needbased scholarships  any guesses as to how this financial situation might translate to MIT  Also last question, any guesses as to how long it will take to hear back about financial after submitting the missing documents  Thank you in advance and congrats to other admits", "MIT financial aid is exceedingly generous from my experience. I had a similar EFC and we only paid that. Its likely youll hear back well before the decision date, and if you have a competing earlier decision date you should send them an email and ask politely if they can expedite it.", "Be aware that you will receive a MUCH better package from MIT. My estimate is they will provide you with a huge financial aid package. Its definitely worth it. MIT has among the top 4 financial aid programs in the country.", "MIT gave me a pretty great package Everyone told me that if you could get into an Ivy school, you could get full ride and stipends from your local state school, but thats not the case at all especially with places like UVA. MIT and Caltech gave me way better deals than any of the state schools I got into, including the one that I got into the Honors College for.   SFS can move slowly for sure. I also had missing documents a few years ago, but they got back to me before commitment day. The one thing Id say here is, if your final package looks suspiciously low, then its worth calling the financial aid office and seeing whats up. I had a friend who got no aid from Harvard despite having a sibling going to school at the same time she was, and then it turned out that somehow, her sibling got completely erased off her financial aid documents during consideration.", "I cant obviously speak for everyone, but MIT was generous enough with my financial aid. I was also able to successfully appeal my aid offer for more when one of my parents was out of work one year.   My sister went to two different universities one public, one private for undergrad transferred partway through and neither was as generous as MIT despite us being in the same financial situation.", "Financially, MIT is definitely the smarter choice here. Youll need to come up with your EFC ONLY to go to MIT.   UVA is telling you youll need to come up with the other entire half 35k a year Thats where everyones ridiculous student loans come from.  MIT is one of about 10 to 20 universities in the United States that guarantees fullneed is met.  That means they will put a  package together for you that meets all of your financial need to attend. Your need is defined as everything above 7800 your efc a year.   So youyour fam will need to come up with about 4k per semester. You can pay that over a couple months 3 I think maybe 4, sorry I cant remember exactly as my husband pays the bills. So lets say youll need to come up with 1000 a month August to Nov and Jan to April.   I cannot TELL you how much of a deal that is for MIT  If your family doesnt have any savings somewhere for your college that you could use for that 1000 a month, you can do things like getting a private loan, getting a job yourself, a combination etc.  THERE ARE WAYS TO SAVE ON THIS AMOUNT THOUGH  1. Get a triple dorm room instead of a double. CostS estimated by MIT are generally based on a double dorm room I believe. Aim for a cheaper dorm if that exists. I cant remember if the amounts for dorms vary. But if they do, aim for a cheaper one and a triple.  My kid ended up in a triple and we saw our monthly payment amount drop significantly.  2. MIT makes you buy their health insurance and that cost is figured into your tuition and fees. However, if you already have decent health insurance from parents job where MIT thinks that you can get a doctor pretty readily in the Boston Cambridge area, they will not make you pay for their own health insurance. Unfortunately this is completely up to them, they choose if they think that yours is good enough to cover what you might need in Boston or Cambridge. Well its kind of them, its not MIT itself its a company that MIT hires to run this program.  During my kids first semester we paid for the MIT one. Basically they said my husbands insurance from his job wasnt good enough and didnt apply to the area well enough to protect my son.    However this semester my husbands work got a different insurance and we submitted that one to MIT and they decided that one was perfectly fine and good enough. And again that knocked our monthly payments down significantly when that charge came off his bill.  So youre 1,000 a month could potentially end up being 700 a month.  Again, UVA sounds like theyre offering you jack shit to be honest. And for a student of your caliber IE you got into MIT UVA should be busting down your door. And theyre stupid for not giving you much more.   You really need to go with MIT or any other college that is guaranteed all need met.", "So SFS moves slow, but I submitted late and still got info before commit day rolled around. Unfortunately just based off your EFC, itll be hard to tell how much aid MIT will give since the CSS profile collects A LOT more information than FAFSA and then theres special circumstance and all that.  Edit If you got into any other schools with aid policies similar to MIT, that might be a good baseline. UVA is a public that doesnt seem to meet full need, so probably not a good comparison.", "MIT has a net price calculator here that you can use  httpssfs.mit.eduundergraduatestudentsthecostofattendanceestimateyourcost.  Im not familiar with UVA, but it might be worth it to check their net price calculator and match it with their official calculation of what they think your family can pay.  I know of people who had typos in their FAFSA which affected their financial aid.", "Just adding to this, MIT has a specific office for paying students to do research. At most schools, you either have to work as a volunteer or get your advisor to pay for you which often wont happen until youre a semester in at least. Not only this make it easier to find research opportunities since professors dont have to pay, but it also means you can make money doing resumebuilding work. Granted, theres a cap on how many hours of UROP you can get paid for, but it still helps.   Again, UVA sounds like theyre offering you jack shit to be honest. And for a student of your caliber IE you got into MIT UVA should be busting down your door. And theyre stupid for not giving you much more.  Unfortunately, a lot of state schools are overwhelmed with demand. As a result, they not only have to stretch their dollar thinner, but they also have a huge pool with many very excellent students, many of whom wont get into Ivy schools. The acceptance rate at MIT was 4 last year and 7 before that getting in requires either a godly resume or some amount of luck. Its not feasible for them to offer many full rides, and they often dont hone in on the same students who got into say, MIT.   My state schools were the UCs, which were very high in demand. If I didnt go, someone with the same or better scores, grades, and comparable extraccurriculars would have gladly gone. Consequently, UCLA only gave me 10kyear. A few kids at my school got way more, almost full rides, and none of those kids got into Ivy schools. My friend who also went to MIT got 1 cent of financial aid from UCLA...Not that he needed it, but you get the idea.", "MIT uses a different formula than FAFSA, so you should be careful about assuming they will calculate your EFC in the same way.  But I would guess if anything, their formula works in your favor compared to the FAFSA formula.", "Graduate housing on vs off campus", "I see that the cheapest efficiency appt for single students is around 1,662 month.

For literally any other housing situation ok with roommates, have a partner youll be splitting the cost with, etc. offcampus is cheaper. Often much cheaper. Especially if youre willing to be 23 miles from campus and bike in instead of walking.  For example, I live in a 2bedroom where the total rent is 2200 I pay 1100, my place is much nicer than living in e.g. Tang, and probably has a nicer kitchen than any oncampus dorm.

Most of the classes I would liked to have taken were running in a modified virtual version which seemed kinda watered down to me. Given that tuition wasnt drastically reduced I determined itd be the best option.  Honestly it was a good break to stagger my MIT career. I was able to get some professional insights that you simply dont have enough time to get in normal 3month internships. I definitely think those skills came through in my classwork. I was also able to get a much better sense of whether industry and particularly the company that I worked ats industry was right for me. It gave me a new confidence to pursue specific opportunities on campus and attend events that I would otherwise not have known whether theyd be helpful  useful.  I think in general 8month coops, if youre up for it, can be a great way to realign yourself with why youre really here.  However, there were some downsides. If you dont like the work, sucks youre in it for 8 months.

This is sort of just me venting into the void so please delete it if its not appropriate for this reddit.   Today I saw in my email that there was a survey for the mit student experience and I decided to do it cuz why not. One of the questions was like I have friends at MIT and I knew the answer to that was strongly disagree which made me start laughing and then I broke down into crying on my bed for some time.  I literally have zero friends at this school and Im a sophomore already. I dont really know what went wrong with me. During high school I was a quiet kid but I was kinda adopted into my friend group by a popular kid who is still by best friend to this date. I started coming out of my shell a bit more and eventually felt socially comfortable at my high school. I still miss those days alot, my previous friends have now gone to other colleges.   When I got into mit, of course I was surprised and happy and all that. But a tiny part inside me was dreading the fact that I would have to go to a new city all alone. That tiny part knew that I would probably retreat back into my shell in such an unfamiliar place. But then COVID happened, and it was announced that us 2024s would not be coming to campus for our first year. I dont really remember how I felt about that, maybe part relief of getting to stay with the people I know for a bit longer, part dread of knowing eventually I would have to go.   So first year fall semester was fully remote, that went okay for me. I didnt make any friends then but I just told myself its because everythings remote, Ill have plenty of chances when we get back to campus. Then comes spring semester and 2024s get the option to come to campus or stay remote. It was during this time that something personal and bad happened, so ultimately I couldnt go to campus for spring. I did my classes and everything and told myself I would make friends when my sophomore year started   Sophomore fall semester starts and I find myself struggling a little to get used to student life on campus. Managing walk time between classes, figuring out food, all that logistical stuff. Classes were rough and my grades werent as high as last year. My mental health has never been so great, but it was this semester where I started spiraling. I used s3 where I could and have a therapist but that tiny feeling of dread that I had a year ago had grown into a vortex of negative emotions. Still no friends. Clubs and activities exist to join, but I already felt overwhelmed by course work, not to mention anxiety of just being with people I dont know. Its here where I start to feel like Ill never make any friends here.  It just sucks. I dont know how college social life is supposed to work. Everybody is in a rush to their classes and is busy with parts and Im the same, so I dont feel like I have opportunities to like socialize at lectures or recitations. I live in a dorm and my neighbors are polite but we never talk to each other or hang out. Above all, I feel like the 2024s who did choose to go on campus first year spring have already formed their friend groups with the help of the pods system. It just feels impossible for me to get to know anyone outside of saying hi or ooh yeah that was a hard pset. Im not a very outgoing person and I feel trapped by it. It feels like everybody else has it figured out, everyone else has friends, can better manage classclubs and have good grades at the same time.  Its spring semester of sophomore year now and nothing has changed. And I think I believe nothing ever will. I know that I cant just sit around and expect friends to line up for me, but Im too tired or unmotivated or anxious to do much else. I know I dont have anyone else to blame except myself and I just feel powerless because of that.   This is such a great school and what really burns is the feeling of all the opportunities and experiences Ill never have. Like staying after lecture and getting to know a professor and maybe eventually uroping with them, or going to parties with friends, or something just as simple as seeing someone you know walking down the infinity and saying hi.  I dont know where Im going with all this, both Im the context of this post and my life at mit as a whole. Its just kinda funny how I remember writing about all the cool opportunities at mit for my application essays and now, halfway through my undergrad I havent done a single one. Or how my family always asks if Im doing ok and if I have friends and if my classes are alright and all I can do is lie to their face and say yea Im fine because I dont want them to worry. Im just tired of everything and it feels like nothing can change.  I never imagined I would make it here but I also never imagined that it would hurt this much to be here. So yeah thats it vent end. This will probably get deleted idk lol but I felt like typing this out might help more than swimming in my thoughts and staring at the ceiling for another hour.

I dont know what to say except that it really shouldnt be this bad Please get help. You probably have a better idea than I do what mental health services are available these days. There is no shame in using them  just like youd go to the doctor regularly if you were struggling with managing diabetes or something.   Also, if it helps  everyone at MIT is a shy nerd. Most of us were socially awkward outcasts in high school. What really helped me break out of my shell there was the realization that no one else had any idea what they were doing socially, either.  Best of luck and Internet hugs. Youre not alone.   a socially awkward crusty alum who survived", "Im a junior, and I feel this. The only reason I have some friends is because I met them freshman year, and many friendships crumbled during covid because they were mostly friendships of convenience.  Idk if it helps to know that youre definitely not alone in feeling lonely I do most of the time, but what might help is just having a squad to convert O2 to CO2 with, so hmu and lets psethave dinner sometimes", "hey im currently a student and feel free to DM me if you want to talk i think ive spent most of my time at MIT feeling lonely even though i guess on the outside ive been lucky to make some great friends. i think sometimes we see all these super amazing people around us and get fomo from seeing everything they do, which can really contribute to the loneliness and feelings of inadequacy. but i think that a lot of people feel the same as you do.  some good ways to balance classes  trying to make friends is to go sit in office hours and pset there, maybe approach some people if theyre working on similar problems and ask to work with them. eventually if you see each other around a bunch or really vibe then be like oh do you want to keep working outside of class. another thing is to just work in your dorm lounge if people tend to be there.", "I kind of felt similar, as someone who graduated last year. While I did get to know people in my dorm, and people in my classes from doing psets together, I didnt really spend time with people outside of that. I have a few good friends, but since COVID started, and after graduation, Ive barely kept in touch with them. If I had started MIT remotely, I dont know if I would have made any friends at all.", "Im a freshman and I definitely can relate to some of the things youve mentioned. Even though it was our first time on campus, during the fall it felt like most other firstyears already knew people and already had friend groups. I guess part of that is because I didnt do a good job of meeting people and making friends during orientation, which is when a lot of others did. Another factor was that many people had reached out to other incoming freshmen over the summer via social media, which is something Ive never really been good at.  That being said, things did get better Ive found that theres a really great snowball effect to meeting people  one you become close with one person, youll meet some of their friends, and then some of those peoples friends, and so on. And, I think you can meet people in unexpected ways  one of the first close friends I made on campus was because I connected with them on LinkedIn of all places, and I sent them a message saying hi and asking about what classes they were taking, which led to a longer conversation and eventually to us meeting up IRL. This person is now one of my closest friends and I hang out with them almost every day.  In terms of balancing time, Ive found that meals dinner especially are a great time to hang out and catch up with people since youre usually not working while eating. I usually enjoy working in the same room lounge or larger dorm room as friends as well, even if were working on different things since we can often feed off of each others productivity with the occasional joke or discussion here and there. Also, going to floor study breaks is a good way to take a few minutes off and meet some people who live near you.  Finally, as I said Im a current student, so please feel free to dm me if you want someone to talk to, or to grab dinner with. I think others have given some great advice on this thread so far, and I sincerely hope youre able to find some of it helpful.", "Just commenting to say youre not alone. The best part of MIT for me was leaving. I didnt make any friends in my major because I fell behind and to be honest they werent the most welcoming bunch either. I did make friends in my living group but I fell out with just about all of them before my super senior year. So I had no friends by the end. I have no advice for you, Im sorry  just know youre not weird for going through this and feeling this way. Best of luck", "Hi there I know how hard it can be at times to feel like part of a group here. Do you play any video games I have a group of friends who play casual things like Mario Party and Smash Bros. Would be happy to have you come join us on a weekend", "Your feelings are certainly shared by many. Take the time to shake up your current schedule. Whether that be by committing to a club e.g. volleyball, dance, rocket team, joining a UROP, or simply scheduling hours to do psets with classmates that youve newly met. Think less, do more. There will always be time to think afterwards.", "I also feel lonely frequently at MIT and not for a lack of being part of a couple social circles. Being social, especially as a person who tends towards introversion, feels like work and practicing a difficult skill.  It can feel disheartening to see a lack of people reaching out or realizing there is no consistency in interactions day to day, but in an environment where so many people are hosed and moving about I think it is common to find oneself struggling with loneliness.  I was the adopted friend in HS too and something that I am grateful about after being removed from that dynamic is that I had to learn how to develop my own social life and find people I chose to continue to build connections with, despite the difficulty. My life is not like a sitcom of consistent friend groups, but I get to hang out with cool people once in a blue moon when our schedules line up and I cherish those moments.", "Im sorry that you are struggling so much with loneliness at MIT. I can definitely remember times when I was pretty damn miserable and lonely there myself. Its not uncommon to feel exactly how you are feeling.   That being said MIT is really cool because in a lot of ways you get back what you put into it. Think about the stuff you find interestingfunexciting and see if there are groups that engage in your interests. I did that once upon a time and while I was never the most social of butterflies I did find people who became lifelong friends. You dont need to dramatically force yourself out of your comfort zone reddit is also a good option if you want to connect with folks more anonymously or less in person but you may need to put yourself out there a little more to give people a chance to meet you socially. Look into social groups at MIT and in Boston. See whats out there and challenge yourself to go meetings and see whos there. Maybe you dont end up wanting to socialize that way but along the way you can meet one or two or more interesting folks to get to know and who can help alleviate some of the loneliness.   What youre feeling is 100 normal, but dont let it scare you away from getting out and meeting people especially the ones who like what you like. You will almost certainly be surprised at how cool some of the folks you meet are and how much you will have in common with some of them. Just remember that if it feels like people are in too much of a rush under normal circumstances then meeting them in social situations i.e. social group meetings is a good waytime to catch them when they arent rushing around dealing with all the craziness that is MIT.", "And I think I believe nothing ever will.  Start by not thinking this anymore. I know its hard, but tomorrow is unwritten for all of us.  You mention no time for clubs, sports, etc. Make some time. Even an hour a week.

Heres some ideas  Run with someone  Frisbee   Dancing ballroom dance club  Musical instruments  Darts  Aikido or tae kwan do  Boxing  For all of these and many more, there are clubs and groups that welcome everyone from beginners to olympians.

I genuinely mean it. Always believe things will change for the better if you try.", "Hey, i totally feel you. Im the same. I know the other commentors have good will in mind. But sometimes, things like joining extracurricular or social groups is just too big a jump from the normal routine. theres too much friction involved. Considering the workload, rushed schedules, and a more introverted personality, I  dont want to be worrying about the dynamics in a reallife chat. it makes me anxious.  idk if this helps but my friends are building an option which reduces a lot of friction. a socialaudio app that brings college students in Boston together to share interesting stories, talk 11 through audio. The goal is to remove loneliness and build a community where every student can feel heard. Sort of like you post a specific thought and someone whos keen to talk about it will call you and chat 11, skipping the small talk. or you can browse and call others.  They use me as one of their case studies. they r prolly launching before summer.  I told them I want ondemand convos even when Im in the dorm. That way as compared to joining social clubs irl, i can save time and dont have to be that awkward, after all, its voice.  With that said, voice calls can never replace irl interactions, Im fully cognizant of that. but i guess with this option, it reduces a lot of friction time, awkwardness, effort. and if we manage to hit it off, its not too late to meet up and have dinner, it catalyzes more interactions by improving students accessibility. it will still require effort on your part to call, but its a lot lesser than physically going to places and chatting with other students irl, which is what Ive been looking for.  Im not sure will this increase your hope that the future will be better bcos of more options. if not, just know that were in this shit tgt and were tryna solve this too.  Grads seem to sing the same song in the working society, your grades mean nothing, who you know and how you interact with others mean the world. make the best out of college.  And ive been trying to expand my social circle sincerely but ive been running into the same problems as you. sigh... im willing to put in effort but not too drastic change in routine.  college will be a lot more fun when we get ondemand convos without harassers or trollers, but just people whos looking to truly chat, exchange stories and best case scenario, make new friends. i believe in a better future in college and i hope you can hold onto that hope too.   .", "Current freshman DM me and we can hang out Even if you dont want to meet up, I really hope things get better.

I particularly loved the sounds and line quality of the thick pieces of chalk some of the professors used.  Its been 30 years since I was there.  Are they still in use, or has everything gone the way of whiteboards andor electronic projectors   Edit  Im so happy to hear the sliding boards  chalk are still widely used.   I love this entire article on the power of the blackboardhttpsphysicsworld.comathepoweroftheblackboard, but here are a few favorite excerpts  There are no electronics to malfunction or bulbs to burn out, as was often the case with the overhead projectors that once sought to usurp the blackboards role. Its easy to edit the surface, leaving parts of what youve written while erasing others. And theres no more satisfying way of starting afresh on a problem than wiping your earlier thoughts with a damp cloth to return to that lightabsorbing void.  Sure, whiteboards dont cloud you in dust, but nor do they capture the same aesthetic. Besides, the pens smell and dry up, they slip and slide on the shiny surface, and theyre easily smudged.  Using a blackboard also moderates the pace of a discussion or explanation. Blackboards help in teaching by slowing down the lecture and allowing the students to absorb information and knowledge at a more human rate. Students in Mathurs firstyear introductory physics class overwhelmingly favour the blackboard over PowerPoint as the primary means of communication.  The time and effort involved in using a blackboard can be good discipline for communication too. PowerPoint speakers who flash up slide after equationpacked slide would have to speak more slowly and think twice about what to include if forced to write everything out by hand. Blackboards, Ipek notes, regulate ones talking speed and give the audience time to absorb the ideas and ask questions. At Fermilab we have a journal club where each week one person gives a blackboard summary of an interesting paper. One week we had a talk with slides, and everyone complained.  Theres also something about a blackboard that seems to fit with the way the mind works sketching, erasing, supporting a free flow of ideas. Many physicists like to do a backoftheenvelope calculation before delving deeper into a computation, and blackboards are a great tool for that, says Tibra Ali, another theorist at the Perimeter Institute. Indeed, theres a trophylike quality to a clever piece of work prominently displayed on a blackboard. Some physicists like transcribing a hardwon solution onto a blackboard to understand the full ramifications  and perhaps just to gloat.   Like historical relics and works of art, blackboards may themselves become venerated objects, imbued with almost mystical significance. The blackboard used by Einstein when he gave three lectures on general relativity at the University of Oxford in 1931 has been preserved as a historical artefact at the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford. There used to be two blackboards, but one disappeared in mysterious circumstances, according to former museum director Jim Bennett. The board shows Einsteins calculations of the age, size and density of the universe, and it has become the most famous object in the collection. People come to the door of the museum and say Where is Einsteins blackboard, says Bennett. Its become a sort of icon. People come and look at it as if is was almost a sort of quasireligious object.   Feynmans blackboard at the California Institute of Technology was photographed at the time of his death in 1988, and seems almost tailored to serve as an epitaph for the great scientist. What I cannot create I do not understand, he had written  followed by what might be seen as a corollary Know how to solve every problem that has been solved. Feynman might just as well have written these thoughts in his notebook. But how much more mystique and pathos they acquire on a blackboard.  This video on chalkhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvPhNUjg9X4g8 also makes me happy.  Masters of their craft caring about their tools.", "The big lecture halls still use chalk lol", "I think the only classroom Ive seen with whiteboards is the TEAL room.", "Yeah.

Probably the same ones in those videos cuz they look old as hell.", "Are You Voting For or Against the Graduate Union Why", "", "For. The main reasons are to have pay adjusted with inflation, to have better mental health access on campus, and to support international students. Its just a good deal and in the financial and health interests of every grad student.", "For. Im one of those fellowship holders who was told to get bent by MIT when I brought up the fact that they were violating the terms of my fellowship. Essentially they make me work a second RA to cover a tuition shortfall when the terms of the fellowship prohibit that. Theyre supposed to waive the difference. While mine is funded by a different federal agency, they were doing this to NSF fellows too and the NSF Inspector General just last week told MIT to stop. You can check that out here   httpsoig.nsf.govsitesdefaultfilesreports202203226001MITRoutineActivityGRFPredacted.pdf  To me, this just goes to show that we need a stronger base of power to push back against the Institute. Thankfully, by forcing me to work an RA, I get to vote in the election, even after the Institute forced the fellows to be cut from the bargaining unit  Another thing that Id like to see change is the charging of full tuition after classes are done as a PhD candidate. I was previously a grad student elsewhere and I know students around the country. It is extremely rare for a school to do that and Id estimate that MIT is pulling in over 50 million per year from us from this policy. If they need to charge us some overhead, fine, but 60K per year for practically nothing in exchange is unacceptable. Not to mention that by reducing our costs, we would likely graduate sooner, since wed by less likely to need to work second RAs or TAs in our last year or two.  In a similar vein, how about them tearing down the most affordable grad housing on campus and replacing it with the most expensive Nice one, MIT. Im sure youre making a tidy profit off that.  Other things Id like to see change Yeah, the dental would be nice. While not talked about by the GSU folks, the Harvard contract makes the school help pay for conference travel directly, rather than on reimbursement. I think that would make conference travel more financially comfortable for students.  I dont expect us to necessarily win all of the victories we desire in the first contract. But Im tired of being powerless against what I see as abuses by the Institute.", "I need to do some more reading but Im tempted to vote for it just because the administration is pushing so hard against it", "For", "FOR Grad workers are WORKERS teaching research etc that all benefit the institute directly. For that alone we deserve to have a say in our own working conditions, and grad unions at other universities things have won things like dental insurance, increased benefits for grads with families, protections against harassment, and cost of living adjustments. Those are all things I want but Im not gonna get them unless we have real bargaining power.  While the admin has listened to some suggestions in recent years, that is basically just by chance, and they are not structurally obligated to meet our needs or even listen to our concerns. Especially with a new administration coming around the corner, we need to secure a seat at the table or who knows what will happen. Its justsmart and responsible to ensure our needs are heard and met.  The only objection I could really see is that the UE is not us somehow. But the GSU is not a shady third party coming in to mess things up which is how the admin has been painting it but literally a bunch of dedicated MIT grad workers who are tired of being treated like we should be grateful to be here. Think of the national UE as like a protocol that groups can follow when they want to organize to take back some of the power that their employers currently deny them.   On that note I have to say I am pushed even more toward voting Yes after reading the scare tactic Union busting emails the administration has sent outthey are trying to exclude a lot of workers from voting and then blaming it somehow on the GSU by pretending like the work they do doesnt contribute anything of value back to the institute which isfrankly insulting and obviously inaccurate.  From the end of child labor to the 2 day weekendunions are on the right side of history Thats why so many tech workers are unionizing right now most recently at The NY Times. They know its good for them and so should we", "For As an undergrad at MIT, I was involved in student government and the administrators I met with basically dismissed all student concerns and constantly talked over me in meetings.   One summer, we were negotiating over changes to a dorm policy, and I would send them the text of the latest change, there would be radio silence for 4 weeks, and then I would get feedback to completely rewrite the policy in the next 24 hours to meet new requirements that we hadnt agreed on or else the administration would just change it to exactly what they wanted. This gave me no time to consult the students I nominally represented, who were scattered across the world and mostly working fulltime over the summer. I was also working fulltime and in a different time zone from MIT. Predictably, this was a complete shit show and admin got exactly what they wanted in the end, pissing off most of the residents of my dorm. I ended up quitting student government because I felt like I had wasted my life getting jerked around by admin, and had achieved nothing other than making other people in my dorm mad at me.  This experience really soured me on the power of student government on MIT  MIT claims to value student perspectives, but consistently ignores student recommendations see the lack of kitchens in New Vassar, the removal of mutual selection during floor rush in undergrad dorms, the Eastgate closure, and so on.   As a grad student, I started talking to people in the union and learned that unsurprisingly student government at the grad level deals with the exact same issues I dealt with as an undergrad httpsthetech.com20211115graduatestudentleadersgsuhttpsthetech.com20211115graduatestudentleadersgsu . The Tech article says it best, but basically MIT often simply ignores GSC recommendations on stipends  housing, and BGSA recommendations on DEI, and so on. If you want to learn more about the issues discussed here, feel free to email any of the coauthors of the article  theyre all great people who can answer questions about their experiences in detail.  With a union, MIT is legally required to negotiate on certain issues related to stipends, benefits, and working conditions. Student workers will have an actual voice on these issues, and MIT will have to take our demands seriously. I believe this will change my life for the better, and will change other grad student workers lives for the better.   And for the record, I do think grad students are workers.  My lab has 1 PI, 2 postdocs, and 30 grad students. So, which group is doing the majority of the research Most classes in my department have multiple grad TAs. So, whos writing the psets, teaching the recitations and doing all the grading Without grad students, MITs research output would slow to a trickle, and classes would need to be radically restructured or hire a ton of undergrad TAs I guess. MIT works because we do, and we deserve a real say in our working conditions and compensation.  I am excited to vote yes and I encourage others to do so as well", "Undecided. I do think its a little silly to act like grad students are workers in the same way that plumbers and electricians are. Grad students can take a week off whenever they want at a drop of a hat. Grad students miss deadlines all the time. Grad students can make big dumb mistakes and everyone overlooks it because its a learning experience. If someone was directly paying me to do the work I do, and I delivered the quality Ive been delivering... Id expect to be fired. But its okay because Im a student, and not a worker.  Im concerned about a lot of the promises the union is making. For example theyre digging in on getting us dental coverage. Why should I assume the union will give us that What real efforts have been put forth in the past, which didnt work and thus necessitate a union as the solution And how should I believe that the union will act in my interests, rather than the interests of a couple dozen students who end up calling the shots because very few people will actually have the time to engage directly with things like that.  If the dues come out to 600 per student per year a number Ive heard thrown around  correct me if Im wrong, then the 7300 MIT grad students will bring in over 4 million every single year in dues. Where is that money going 4 million dollars is an absolute fuckton and it would be nice to see a preliminary budget showing what my money is being spent on and how its directly benefiting us. I havent seen a lot of direct numbers and data from the union to convince me its a good idea  only a ton of vague promises that feel like someone running for president. Overall, Id love to see an actionable list of what the union wants to achieve in its first year so that, after a year, we can evaluate whether its really doing what it set out to do. Unions are great, and I support the idea of them, but I fear that this particular union being proposed may not actually deliver a benefit which is commensurate with its cost.  I also really dont feel great about how they said Were affiliated with UE. Take it or leave it and thats the only choice, rather than having... ANY transparency and allowing the students who are being represented to have a say in what direction we go with any potential union.  Its really annoying how everyone has an agenda. The MIT administration acts like the union is a useless waste of time that will make everything worse. The GSU members act like the union is a gift directly from god that will fix everything bad in the world. The reality is that its a thing that has pros and cons. And I wish I could see the GSU lay out the cons in an honest fashion and say But despite those cons, we believe this is worth it rather than everything Ive seen that brushes the cons under the rug and pretends they dont exist.", "No longer a student... but if I was Id vote no simply based on how poorly it was managed when it was still underground and how everyone involved had their own agenda  from the Sloan students who were only involved to put it on their resume to the people who only wanted to fuck admin and the people who were doing it to escape research because they were no longer interested. Also most people involved has such negative views about the school it clouded their ability to have coherent level headed and well rounded goals.  It never felt like anyone there cared about the populous or honestly even engaged with people outside the union ingroup. Admin also doesnt care about the populous so it doesnt feel like were getting anywhere.", "Wow, this is a really, really big deal. The way MIT historically structured things for NSF GRFP recipients exposed them to huge tax liabilities and complications, which the Institute did extraordinarily little to allay. I know several people who went through lengthy read multi year processes with lawyers and the IRS to resolve these issues. Expensive wastes of time for individuals who are really making near poverty wages when you factor in cost of housing in Cambridge.  Kudos to the NSF for calling this out.", "Im all for it, but is it possible to do this without the UE Just have our own union, it is like now we deal with another administration...", "I feel this way too at first, but union representatives called me on the phone and used propaganda tactics like asking leading questions.   I am very concerned by the MIT administrations behavior through this whole thing though.", " While the admin has listened to some suggestions in recent years, that is basically just by chance, and they are not structurally obligated to meet our needs or even listen to our concerns.  This right here. Without a union to put actual pressure on MIT, the administration has no reason to provide anything beyond the bare minimum they think they can get away with. They know that MITs reputation will always lure in a lot of wellqualified graduate applicants and that once theyre here, its extremely difficult to transfer somewhere else. So unless graduate students especially those who dont have parents supporting them or those who have a family of their own want to start quitting en masse or drown in rising living costs, I dont see any other option but to start a union and negotiate for the conditions they deserve.

This opedhttpsthetech.com20211115graduatestudentleadersgsu does a pretty good job explaining the inherent power imbalance and structural obstacles of securing change through existing advocacy channels   A union is the only way to legally get that power to sit down and negotiate with admin to enact some long overdue changes for grad workers.", "I definitely wasam not able to take a week off whenever...at a drop of a hat and dealt with a very inflexible advisor.

I had pretty much no bio background and it was enough for me to pass the test.  If you have any coding background, the 6.0001 is very doable too. The exam is just a few coding problems in python.  If youve learned calculus in the past, it would probably be a good idea to take 18.01. However, since 18.01 and 18.02 are fundamental for pretty much all majors, taking the course might be a good idea in order to have a solid background. I have a few friends who have regretted ASEing 18.01 since they dont feel as prepared for other math classes like 18.03 or 18.06. But of course if you feel solid in the subject you should definitely give the ASE a go.  The chemistry and physics ASEs would definitely be difficult if you dont have a good background in the subjects, so Id recommend not doing those.", "Humanities at MIT are great  I would recommend using MIT OCW to study for the 18.01 ASE.

Heres my take  Bio ASE is pretty easy to pass with edX and OCW materials, and that should be especially true for you if bio went well for you.  I would also recommend using OCW for math ASEs 18.02 was fairly easy with OCW, and I probably barely passed 18.01 lmao but I took Calc BC freshman year of HS and should have spent more time reviewing.  Cant speak to 8.01 ASE got AP credit, but mechanics is decently intuitive and you could try if you want. The point I make about taking 8.02 also holds here, though. I failed the 8.02 ASE after taking EM in junior year of HS and forgetting everything not that I had a great understanding in the first place I tried studying using OCW lectures but the stuff wasnt making sense to me anymore. However, EM is a less intuitive subject in general and if you have a weaker physics background, I think it could be valuable to take the class, and it could help you gain a better appreciation for physics too I think it helped me with that.  As others have said, 5.111 ASE is notoriously difficult. I did not take it and would not recommend selfstudying.

Ashdown should be easier, but oncampus housing is literally assigned through a lottery, so you might still not get one. SidPac, Tang, and Edgerton if you are OK with going unfurnished are all fine options as well. Some may disagree on Tang, but its cheap and if you get lucky you will have a very nice view of the Charles.   How much can I expect to pay for accoms in such housing if I share  Depends where it is and how many you share with. Tang is the cheapest furnished option, I think its something like 1,100month if you share an apt with three others. Ashdown is about 1,3001,500 or so if you share a two or threebed. The Warehouse is more expensive maybe 1,7001,800 Im not quite sure because the apartments are all studios. SidPac is around the same price as Ashdown the grad tower at site 4 is the most expensive, and getting a studio there will eat up like 75 of your monthly salary so I would really recommend avoiding it unless you have expensive taste.  So, it really depends. Plus, prices may change from one year to the next. If you are planning on living on campus and you are willing to share your apartment, then I would budget for around 1500, just to be on the safe side.   Can I finish TQE and RQE within 2 years if I push for it say if I finish TQE within 23 semesters and RQE on the 4th  You probably could, but I would advise against trying to speedrun the requirements. Taking 2 TQEs in one semester often makes it very hard to get research done at the same time Ive done it, since many of the TQEs are quite timeconsuming. Sure, you can pick TQEs in subjects that you are already familiar with, but then whats the point Plus, the ultimate requirement to finish the PhD is to produce good research. Speedrunning any formal requirements is unlikely to help you do so any faster in my experience, slow and steady definitely wins the research race.   Can the subjects taken for TQE double count for the SM degree  Yes, I believe this is the case. The SM degree requirement is a bit weird at MIT EECS to be honest  I think the only difference if you already have a Masters degree before coming here is that they wont make you submit a Masters thesis, but thats a minor point anyway.   Are there any other tips that would be good to know beforehand  Go to the visit days, pay attention and dont be afraid to ask questions Go to other schools visit days if you applied elsewhere, ask questions there If there is a professor you are interested in working with, explicitly say that to them and explicitly ask if they would be willing to take you on  dont leave room for any nasty surprises. Its a million times better to have professor X tell you at the visit day that they dont have enough funding to take on another student than to have that happen to you after youve accepted the offer.

Most students are useless researchers in their first couple of years, but they think theyre the only one and everyone else is doing OK, because no one really voices this concern to their friends.  Classes are never the focus in EECS. Dont worry too much about TQE, dont focus too much on classes TQE classes are somewhat grade inflated, but make sure to build relationships with your fellow students, and take orientation seriously  once you take your 4 required classes, everybody will disappear into their lab and you will almost literally never see them again if you dont already have a good friendship with them. Try to go to EECS GSA coffee hours if they are still happening during COVID, its free coffee and you get to meet a lot of people.  Related to the point above, try to get into Ashdown, SidPac or Warehouse your first year, you can move offcampus after that. We had rumors in my year that if you put Tang anywhere in your choices, you will get Tang. Unless you are super rich, you will need housemates, so think of suitable people. I dont know what its like these days, but a few years ago you could expect to pay 10001200mo for a bedroom in walkingbiking distance to campus.  RQE is a friendly exercise in giving a research talk. Unlike other departments, EECS does not use qualifying exam as a way of second admission, as in it wont filter out a significant number of students from the program. Passingfailing mostly boils down to the support letter written by your advisor ahead of the exam which will almost always be positive unless you significantly mess up throughout the 3 years before the quals. You get to suggest who should be in your exam committee, they dont have to follow your suggestion, but most of the time they will. Youll have a better idea whos suitable for it after taking classes. Remember that your RQE committee can also be your future thesis committee members.  If you find that you do not get along with your advisor, or simply dont like your research field, changing labs is fairly common. Students with fellowships get to rotate between labs in their first year, which is strongly recommended even if you think you know which lab you want to work in. You cant judge certain aspects of a lab without actually working there for a while. PIs know this is part of the grad school process and will appreciate you taking the time to make an informed decision.  In a place away from the lab, talk to other students, maybe buy them a coffee, ask them about the lab and PI. Theyll be mostly honest about their experience. If they tell you to run, then run. Some PIs will themselves suggest you reach out to students in their lab, thats a good sign for their character, but still dont pass on the suggestion.  When you start work with the lab, identify your mentor structure senior grad student postdoc PI themself and dont be afraid to ask questions. Try to learn your PIs expectations most are notoriously reluctant to give you a clear structure and hold yourself to those expectations.  Academic requirements thesis proposal, RQE, etc. are less big of a deal than you think. As long as you have your advisors support, they will be a breeze. Dont delay them out of fear that you will fail that will just delay your PhD.  Make use of the Harvard crossregistration, especially for your minor. You are always limited to 2 classes per semester, but you probably wont be able to take even one class per semester in your later years, so plan ahead.  Remember that the entire EECS grad office is on your side. They already invested in you by admitting you, and its in their best interest to see you succeed.", "I recommend joining EECS GSA. I was once a coffee hour chair of the association and had real fun while organizing every coffee hour on the 8th floor of Bldg. 36... Also, during your first year, nobody expects you to excel, and personally, you should rather spend it probing as many research groups as possible to find your asylum for the rest 5  6 years.

IIRC some dorms had limited summer storage for continuing residents preCOVID, like six boxes per person or so. Most FSILGs have a LOT of storage space for house members.  If you cant get free storage, its also pretty common for groups of undergrads to rent storage together to save money. In the spring, youll see PODShttpswww.pods.com everywhere outside the undergrad dorms  they will drop off a bigass storage container, you and your friends fill it up, they take it to their storage facility for the summer, and they bring it back to you in August or September so you can get your stuff. In undergrad, my friends and I also used Storage Squadhttpswww.storagesquad.com I think it was cheaper for the amount of stuff we had.  If youre only storing your own stuff and are planning to rent a UHaul to move to a new apartment in the fall anyway, I would recommend doing UHaul selfstoragehttpswww.uhaul.comStorage. There is a UHaul in Central where you could rent a locker, and if you currently live on campusnear Central and dont have too much stuff you could probably roll all your stuff to the locker on a storage cart without paying for an Uber or UHaul truck to get your stuff to the locker. Then in the fall, you can just UHaul your stuff to your new apartment.  If youre only storing your own stuff and arent planning to rent a UHaul at any point, just do Storage Squadhttpswww.storagesquad.com or some other cheap service that will pick up and drop off the stuff for you. I can vouch for Storage Squad being legit and not too expensive because Ive used it before, but Im sure there are other decent places as well.   I think the dorms make you pay for insurance but theres no storage fee, at least when I did this in like summer 2018.

I am about equally interested. Im really just looking for anyone who has taken one of the two to share a brief summary of their experience  to help me choose I dont know anyone who has taken either, which is why Im here. Thanks in advance ", "Have taken both. For context, Im a course 14, and 21H.161 is the only history class Ive taken.   14.01 is a semitechnical class. Youll have weekly psets that are mathbased, as well as midterms that are math based. Although you get a HASS credit for this class, it is very much a mathheavy class although the math is not complicated, just basic maximization for the most part, 18.012 stuff. If you might be interested in taking more course 14 classes, you will for the most part have to start with 14.01, so it might be good to get it out of the way. However, it sounds like that isnt really something youre interested in at the moment.  On the other hand, 21H.161 is a more traditional HASS. I found the content very interesting and novel to me, the discussion sections insightful, and Prof. Alimagham to be one of the better profs Ive had at MIT. Youll have weekly readings and a couple papers as it is a CIH, but I found the workload relatively tame.  All in all, I cant say one is better than the other. As a oneoff, I really enjoyed 21H.161, as the content was interesting and the instruction was well done. However, 14.01 was pretty formative for me, as it partially inspired me to major in 14.01 I did take it with Gruber, who is not teaching it this semester. Ive heard that Ellison isnt the best lecturer of all time. I think 14.01 is arguably the more useful class, but thats a biased course 14 view of it. Id decide what type of class youre looking for, either a more technical class or a traditional HASS, and have that inform your decision.

Thanks for the insight", "For 14.01, the issue is not that it is math focused, but rather that they rely on the TAs to teach the math in the recitation section. This is what is tested for on the tests and much of the theory in lecture will only go so far. This means that, depending on the group of TAs, 14.01 can either be fun or excruciating based on how much knowledge and effort the TAs have regardless of your love for math.", "Fascinating, thanks", "14.02 is also an option  what are your thoughts on 14.01 vs 14.02 in terms of workloadbenefit Also for 21H.161, is the recitation requiredgraded", "First, 14.01 is a microecon course, not macro. This might be a good foundation in economics that would benefit your EI minor. Theres a reason 151 and 153 majors have to take 14.01 or an intro Econ class in Sloan. It wouldnt teach you any new skills per say, but might help you think like an economist, which can be helpful in certain business contexts. It also gives you the prerequisite for courses like 14.20 and 14.26, which might be useful for someone interested in innovation.   On the other hand, 14.02 would probably be useless for you. I personally did not enjoy the class at all. I found it very boring, and I dont think it gives a good foundation in macroeconomics. However, it is easier than 14.01 and less work than 21H.161. Out of these three classes, it is the easiest but least interestingbeneficial option, imo.  The recitation for 21H.161 is a discussion section that is strictly required. The class can be oversubscribed sometimes, and if you cant attend either recitation offered, you will not get a slot in the class.", "Thanks for that.

Id say most students can pass 14.02 with as little as 45 hours per week. You dont necessarily have to go to lecture, and the psets are generally pretty quick this was with a different prof, but I think its pretty similar with Caballero. However, if you want to shoot for the A, Id expect something more in the 7 hrswk range although there are those that could certainly get an A with 5 hrswk of work.  14.01 is likely an 89 hour a week class, especially if you have no prior background in economics. For some people, it might be more like 10, for others, it might be more like 7.   14.02 is definitely less time consuming especially if you dont go to lecture, which many people do not. But again, I also think it is a vastly worse class.  With that schedule, Id say either class is very doable, and even both might be doable, depending on how much time youll end up spending on your other classes.

Id say dont buy one before you know you wantneed one  dont get a bunch of stationary unless you prefer paper to using an ipad although many people convert to ipads for convenience you do need some for midterms, and do get a calculator  an eye mask can be helpful if the lights outside your room are too brightthe blinds dont block the light well   Travel for free Idk Ig Im still hopeful about covid getting better   do GTLs  do MISTIs   Uncategorized stuff   people mostly do laundry on the weekends, and it can be frustrating  dont do dumb stuff like smoking andor burning things in the microwave you can set off the fire alarm and the whole building will have to evacuate happens more often than it should  people will sometimes tell you that they dont go to some lectures andor you dont have to go to lecture for X class  dont skip lecture unless you are sick or smth recitations are a different story  depending on the class and your level of knowledge, you can skip them for some classes however, some classes cover important new material in recitations, eg econ classes  Verdes is expensive  only spend dining dollarstech cash there  it can be helpful to get things in small bulks to have you covered for the semester like a few toothbrushes, a few razors, etc Idk because it can be a bit stressful worrying about that stuffrunning out at a busy time Verdes comes in handy in these situations, but it is nice in general if you have a bit of space in your room so you dont have to worry about it  you dont need to be on social media, but everyone uses Messenger for communication, and sometimes Fb can be useful for joining groups etc I survived without it though  get advice on your resume both from capd and from upperclassmen not your peers  unless you are very passionate about fashion, you dont need a lot of clothes, especially formalfancy clothes I get by on 4 sets of hoodies and sweats, and so do most of my friends  FPOPs are usually very fun  dont try to optimize the meal plan  its impossible the minmax is to get the smallest plan you can and get bulk plans instead of weekly plans if you find you spend allmost of the meal swipes on the larger plan, stick with it most people have a bunch left over every semester", "Woo Make friends, make time for hangouts and exploring MIT and the surrounding area, and your profs and TAs are there to help you learn.

The best things Id recommend to do is to  1. Increase the likelihood of your resume being read 2.

Point 2 is focused on making this part easy for the recruiter buff your resume, make it easy to scan very quickly, and decrease any chance of the recruiter tossing your resume aside because youre missing important details about your qualifications or background.  The more important point in my opinion is getting your resume in front of someone in the first place. The best way to do this and from experience, the only successful way to reduce chance in your application is to get referrals. This is the unfortunate reality, as FAANG companies receive insane amounts of applications, and networking is ultimately how most people end up getting these internships.

I guess my dilemma is that I think I want to pursue the cs side of robotics but also have knowledge about the mechanical side. If I do just 63, I can delve deeply into the cs side of robotics, but wont be able to take classes like 2.00034 dynamics and controls, 2.009, and 2.12 intro to robotics. Is the mechanical side of robotics something I can learn through clubs and UROPs If I do the minor in 2, I will be able to find a balance of the two, but might not be able to achieve much depth into the cs side. Also, what are your thoughts on 6.01intro to EECS w robotics vs 6.08intro to EECS w embedded systems Ive heard 6.08 is super fun but perhaps 6.01 might be more useful to me in terms of what I want to pursue. If you have any advice or comments that would be greatly appreciated", "What makes you say you wont be able to take 2.0032.004,  2.12, and 2.009 if you just do 63 It depends how many classes you want to take each semester, but MIT is great because you can take classes in any department even if youre not a major. The caveat is that for classes with limited lab space, majors get preference, but Ive known course 6s in all the classes you mentioned. The same goes if you pick 2A6 you are able to take higher level 2 or 6 classes not strictly needed for your degree although consider putting classes on listener to keep workload more reasonable.  Advice that I heard and is generally pretty good is to go to courseroad, put in all the classes you want to take and their prerequisites, and then figure out what major youre closest to getting  in other words, which major would make you take the fewest additional classes that you wouldnt want to take anyway.  Definitely encourage exploring further through clubs and UROPs, since that will help you refine what kinds of internshipsjobs youre interested in doing. The other great thing about MIT is that you can easily change majors, especially if the majors are very similar and have a lot of overlapping classes that youre taking anyway. So dont stress too much about which major you declare as a frosh, and if possible try to front load classes that would count for both majors, but definitely seek out those clubs and UROPs to help you focus your direction.  Not sure I have great advice on 6.01 vs 6.08, but from what I recall both are pretty solid introductions to EECS, emphasis on introduction 6.01 at least is extremely broad. The theme gives a flavor for the labs but I dont think youd miss out on a ton of roboticsspecific domain knowledge from taking 6.08 instead of 6.01.", "Might want to look at the NEET program, the Autonomous Machines thread might be exactly what youre looking for. I started as a 62 in the thread and ended up switching to 2A because I found I was interested in the mechanical engineering more than I expected, but I know a bunch of 62s and 63s in the program with me. You have to take a few MechE courses for it, 2.001 and 2.003 I think along with a special version of 2.007 made just for the Autonomous Machines students. And youre required to take a robotics class junior spring, like 2.12 or 6.141.

Prestigious schools have large endowments from rich alumni, research grants, etc, so they can pay more to attract wellknown academics.  Even if that wasnt the case, the prestige by itself attract those academics.  Having wellknown academics and having their research published will also increase that prestige, and they attract lots of talented grad students, undergrads, etc.   All that certainly helps when applying for jobs, for applying to schools, applying for research grants....  There are often alumni that have senior positions at that company, university, or research foundation youre applying to.  Right away, you have some shared life experience that not very many people have, and it can certainly help in interviews.  When youre one applicant among dozens, every little bit can help a great deal to distinguish yourself among the others.  I think MIT has some advantages.  Theres the brass rat, which is really unique and stands out IMO, and Ive had many people over the years notice it, including a senior manager many levels above me at a previous job who was an MIT alum.  If you go into a technical field, of course, it helps in particular, although you could still have majored in liberal arts, but the very high mathscience class requirements means that you likely have a decent level of knowledge and exposure.  Heck, employers have just randomly mentioned to others that I went to MIT, to help convince clients that basically weve got some real brainiacs working for us, although my math PhD often gets mentioned also.  For context, my parents immigrated here, were not particularly wealthy, did not have any connections in academia or corporations.  They still dont speak English all that well, although they do understand it, and they didnt really expose me to book learning at home .  So, going to MIT I feel has helped me to make up for those advantages that other people have.    Along the way, I met so many incredibly smart, interesting people.  My major was math, and Ive been fortunate to meet so many wellknown mathematicians, as instructors, advisors, and eventually, other MIT undergrads from my time there.  There are also great MIT alumni groups everywhere, and it can really help when you move somewhere where you dont know anybody.

At your average state university, professors are still doing great research, but its much harder to get involved in it as an undergrad, and seniors applying to grad school might have pretty limited research experience. At MIT its fairly common for freshmen to do research, and not unheard of to graduate with multiple publications. This is a big step up for applying to PhD programs.   I didnt seriously UROP until my junior year, and only had one conference paper where I was like the 15th author before graduating.

I dont think its necessarily about comparing yourself to other MIT students. While I havent fully taken advantage of MITs collaborative culture, the atmosphere isnt at all competitive for me at least, but Ive never been very competitive so Ive never felt the temptation to compare myself to other students. For example, there was this super brilliant student in one of my classes and while I might think hes smarter than I am, Ill never think Im not as smart as him. The latter is selfdeprecating. Im sure some students think like this but I cant speak for them.  I think a lot of students who get into MIT are students who never had to work hard. I.e. never had difficulties grasping concepts and completing assignments. And so its easy to believe that intelligence is simply the ability to comprehend quickly and complete tasks without much thought. Its easy to conflate intelligence with speed. Before Id sit in a lecture and thered already be a conceptual map in my mind, at least 3 steps ahead. Then you get to a place like MIT, and suddenly you need to spend more time with the material, suddenly your conceptual map is challenged, suddenly you cant finish assignments in under 2 hours. And because comprehension and application are now taking longer, you wonder if you were ever as smart as you thought you were. Youve never really been challenged, and more importantly youve never learned how to stand up to an academic challenge. And those feelings of defeat can really affect your selfesteem. For example, not always being right when you answer a question leading to feelings of doubt which when unchecked can diminish confidence.  For a lot of us, we were the smartest kid and so the only real competition was ourselves. So its not always about comparing ourselves to others, its about comparing ourselves to our former selves the kid who was always right, the kid who could joggle it all, the kid who while not knowing everything, quickly learned anything.

I often find that the distraction of taking notes makes it much harder to learn the material, and Id often end up with unintelligible notes on a subject I dont understand anyways. I had a much better time when I started just showing up to class with nothing but myself and listening. Most professors post their slides or notes etc online anyways, so you get the best of both worlds.  Your mileage may vary of course. Some people learn by writing, and some professors dont post notes online. But this was very helpful for me.", "In my opinion, the best tool is preparedness.   Many classes expect that the students enter the lectures with some familiarity of the material.

Everyone has different learning styles and you should feel free to experiment with different strategies until you find one that works for you.  Some people use fancy writing tablets or notetaking apps, while others as mentioned here eschew notetaking entirely to focus on engagement with the instructor and the material. Personally, I found any sort of digital medium too slow and distracting, and exclusively relied on penandpaper notebooks, which I would painstakingly retranscribe every weekend into a second notebook for clarity and legibility. This worked for me because the transcription process doubled as a forced review of the material.

You havent established this. The only reason this was a mistake is that people like you threw a fit about it. What that suggests is that it is a mistake for the university to employ people like you, who try to prevent scientists from doing scientific work because you dont like their politics.", "For starters  The purpose of academic freedom is to promote the unfettered pursuit and transmittal of knowledge. In its founding document in 1915on the eve of the still unmatched suppression of free thought in the academy that accompanied Americas entry into the First World War and the first Red Scarethe American Association of University Professors defined as one of the three elements of academic freedom the obligation of academic institutions to protect scholars freedom of extramural utterance and action. As you know, from that time through the antileft wing witch hunts of the late 1940s and 1950s, continuing through the Vietnam era to now, the greatest threats to academic freedom have arisen precisely from that impulse to bar scholars from the academy and from academic discourse because some or most found their extramural opinions abhorrent. Robert Maynard Hutchins, generally considered the greatest university president of the twentieth century, defined the only way academic freedom can be defended in the face of that threat   The only question that can be properly raised about a professor . . . is his competence in his field. His private life, his political views, his social attitudes, his economic doctrine, these are not the concern of his university still less are they the concern of the public. I have no patience with the philosophy of Yes, but as applied to this matter any position short of the one I have stated will be found to involve such compromises that nothing is left academic of freedom.   In this light, what all of you cite as the purpose and mission to quote Provost Schmidt of the Carlson Lecture matters not a whit. All of you have invoked public outreacha term redolent of corporate public relationsin arguing that in this case MIT need not act according to academic standards. That wont wash. A university is not just primarily an academic institutionit is exclusively so. Just as it rightly enjoys the privileges that status bestows, so too must it adhere to the obligations that status enjoins. Here the only issue that matters is that MIT used nonacademic criteria to silence a scholar in what is most certainly a pedagogical and universitysponsored pursuit, regardless of the lectures intended audience.   Just as important, your arguments that the Carlson Lecture should not be subject to the strictures of academic freedom because it is a public lecture betray a narrow and selfinterested understanding of the academys role in public life. In endowing the lectureship, John H. Carlson defined its purpose to raise awareness about climate. Indeed, the lectureships only stated mission is to communicate exciting new results in climate science to the general public. The lecture series does not exist to help EAPS, the Lorenz Center, or MIT enhance their public images. Presumably, Mr. Carlson believed, correctly, that the best way to fulfill the mission he promulgated was to fund a lectureship in which leading climate scientists not, say, journalists, publicists, and policy advocates illuminate the science. For some eleven years EAPS has sought out the leading climate scientists throughout the world to transmit their work to a lay audience intent on learning the science from the best in the field. EAPS judged Professor Abbot to be one of those scientistsand one who could effectively communicate significant scholarly work to the general public. In canceling Professor Abbots lecture, you have deprived that audience of the opportunity to listen to and learn from a person whom EAPS itself has judged to be a scholar with singularly important ideas to convey to the public. Surely those who attend the Carlson Lecture look to the speaker not for his or her extramural views, but for his or her profound scientific knowledge and understanding.   Provost Schmidt and Professor van der Hilst have attempted to rationalize canceling Professor Abbots lecture by alluding to the notion that the Carlson lecturer should be a role model. A thorough search of public documents and statements related to the Carlson Lectureship yields no mention of this criterion before Professor Abbots invitation was withdrawn, which could lead one to surmise that this supposed desideratum is in fact nothing more than an ex post facto justification for canceling Professor Abbots lecture. Regardless, aspiring scientists no doubt seek as role models scholars who have performed innovative and significant scientific research, and who have carried out their professional duties scrupulously and generouslynot those scholars with whom they may agree on social, academic, or political issues. After all, it would have been a great loss to science, if, say, a gifted young biologist who was also a member of Young Americans for Freedom had spurned Richard Lewontin as an exemplar or mentor because of Lewontins outspoken Marxism. The US Free Speech Union takes no position on Professor Abbots opinions on DEI policies, but for the sake of argument Ill stipulate that those views are wrong and even incendiary. Nevertheless, if one believes that the academy has a responsibility to ensure that members of the public have access to the thinking of the best scholars willing to speak to them, and that academic freedom, and therefore the advancement of knowledge, demands that those scholars be judged on their intellectual distinction and not by their opinions on politics or academic policy, then one is forced to conclude that it is not Professor Abbot who has failed to properly model academic values but the three of you.   The argument that academic freedom does not apply in the case of public lectures delivered under a universitys auspices is to invent a distinction unrecognized by the worlds great universities. Here is a fragmentary list of prominent scholars who made statements or issued lengthy arguments on political, social, and moral questions that many reasonable people rightly or wrongly deemedto quote Professor van der Hilsts condemnations of Professor Abbots viewsinflammatory, deeply offensive, and polarizing. Parenthetically included are some of the renowned public lectures they delivered Eric Hobsbawm the Wiles Lecture, Queens University, Belfast the Nobels Centennial Symposia the Creighton Lecture, Kings College, London, Edward Said the Messenger Lecture, Cornell the Christian Gauss Seminar, Princeton, Christopher Hill the Ford Lecture, Oxford Noam Chomsky the Messenger Lecture, the Christian Gauss Seminar, Eugene Genovese the William E. Massey Lecture, Harvard, Saul Bellow the Romanes Lecture, Oxford, A.J.P Taylor the Romanes Lecture. The list of distinguished scholars and their distinguished lectureships is, of course, wholly unsurprising. It would have been shocking if any of these institutions had withdrawn a lectureship invitation owing to a scholars extramural views and it would have been beneath these institutions to have then waved away that breach of academic freedom by taking MITs position that academic freedom had, in fact, not been violated because, after all, to quote Provost Schmidts corporatespeak, the lectureship is not a standard academic talk for fellow academics. It is an outreach event, open to the public.", " Its not a lazy cliche.  Yeah, allusions to latte liberalism is a pretty lazy way to malign the people with whom you disagree. Its especially ironic since if the Carlson lecture had gone ahead, I guarantee you the community wouldnt have been merely sipping lattes in cambridge and tweeting outrage.  This episode isnt about woke politics and woke language. The crude attempts here to spin it just as such miss the nuance and specific issues that the community raised with Abbots participation as the Carlson lecturer. Abbot has aggressively denounced DEI policies which, regardless of however rightwingers or conservatives are triggered by the concept, seek to address serious structural inequities in academia which provably limit accessibility to the institution and success within it for members of particular racial, social, and gender classes and have a profound, measurable consequence on innovation and all the derivatives benefits for society which come therefrom. But instead of welcoming an open debate to solve these very real problems, Abbot smears the people with whom he disagrees as Nazis.  Its lazy, disingenuous, and offensive. And thats why Abbot lost the Carlson lecture. Hes free to say whatever he wants, and hes free to say it however he wants. But its pretty effing stupid to piss off an alligator and then stick your arm in its mouth, and he shouldnt expect sympathy after he gets it bit off. Honestly, the part that you all keep ignoring is that Abbot made the ultimate rhetorical faux pas  you never invoke Nazism and attack the other party with which youre arguing. Why should anyone play nice with him if thats the tact hes going to take   But do you want to know whats really sick here Dudes playing you.httpswww.newsweek.compoliticalproblemcampusopinion1645065 Abbots no fool hes an accomplished academic. If he really cared about this DEI issue as much as he claims, there are ways that he could have a massive impact on it within institutions like UChicago. Hell, the whole point is that the deck is stacked for people like Abbot to perpetuate the status quo, which is why the policies he decries exist in the very first place. But given his instant celebrity in rightwing and conservativelibertarian political circles, I bet Abbot sees the sort of  that most of his colleagues see by pitching AI to funding agencies. The difference is that this  his money he can pocket  book deals, TV appearances, invited talks, you name it He gets to give up all responsibility of actually effecting change on the issue he supposedly cares about because honestly  no one will ever take him seriously again after this episode and the way he behaved and he gets celebrity, fame, and a a boatload of cash  So yeah.

Didnt say I necessarily agreed with this. Just applying the logic in the linked article to the situation.   So only people who are great at public communication should be scientists Have you thought this through  No one said Abbot shouldnt be a scientist.

Many early career geoscientists are concerned about the lack of diverse representation in the field and the structuralinstitutional inequality which feed the problem And to be very clear, this isnt solely a socialpolitical problem. The lack of diversity in the geosciences has significant implications for the sorts of problems the field prioritizes, which is really acute given the intersection between the geosciences and social sciences through issues such as climate change.

Ive lived and love large metro areas like Los Angeles, SF, and NYC with endless neighborhoods to explore, countless food and neighborhood hangout choices for after work, etc.  Ive lived in Boston for a few years for a research job at an MIT research center, of all places, this is actually where my existing networkengagement with faculty comes from and, to be completely honest, wasnt all that happy in my personal life.  That said, for my research interests, MIT has much more research opportunities and advisors matching my interests compared to, say, Columbia. Based on my experiences, I really imagine at a personal level that the next stage of my life will in NYC, and Im not really willing to give up the rest of my 20s to a smaller city like Boston.  Assuming I have a residence in both Boston and NYC, does anyone know PhD students that commuted back and forth on a weekly basis I imagine 3 or 4 days per week in NYC, with the rest of the week in Boston, could be a reasonable tradeoff, though I might need to test this somehow. If Ill be sitting at my desk coding or reading papers for hours at a time, I think spending 67 of those hours a week in the dining car of an Accela wouldnt make too much of a difference. Ive been a remote MSlevel researcher for the past year or so and have still felt productive.  I would of course be losing inperson networking time with my peers, so some amount of fine tuning would be needed. At the same time, having worked in industry for a few years, Ive gotten pretty good at separating my work and personal life, and familypersonal time in NYC is important to me, where Im resolved to only be willing to work with PIs that can respect this.  I truly love MITs intellectual opportunities, and I find myself trying to convince myself I can pursue them while respecting my more important personalfamily life in NYC. Do people know anyone whos done this Can it be done Is remote work culture here to stay  As a side note, Ive thought halfseriously about waiting till NEC HSR upgrades to do a PhD, so that I could actually commute quicky from NYC to Boston, but I dont think I can wait that long.", "Seems like youre counting your chickens before they hatch.

And Boston is it. Its as close as you can get to the amenities of New York City without the filth. Everythings cleaner, the subways oh my God its like night and day But the parks, the museums,  the technology especially  and the industry and the people...  20 times smarter in aggregate than what you would get in NYC, easily.

It sounds like it would be the solution to getting you the Best of both worlds at least both of YOUR worlds,  how you see them.", "I think this commute would be perfectly reasonable for the latter half of the PhD where you arent taking classes. You just need an advisor who is chill with it. You could be fully remote even.  For your first two year while youre still taking classes, it might be difficult. Most grad classes dont have classes on Friday and only recitations, which are optional. So you could potentially just stay MondayWednesday night, and leave Thursday after class.

These days I dont really talk about the intellectual things I care about i.e. research over dinner because friendsinindustryorotherfields have no clue what you do which is in itself probably a good thing and cant offer much more than a welcoming ear. Me talking about my passion becomes a rather unilateral conversation. I miss fun backandforth conversations in my research area if not for conversations like that, why do grad school And for some reason, I found that most of them happened outside of lab.  I would recommend giving Boston a second shot, though.

Thanks", "Focus on fit, whether its an fsilg or dorm.", "Disclaimer Male alum who wasnt in a frat  I dont see much of a point in joining fratssororities at MIT, at least in comparison to a more typical state school experience. At large public universities   Dorms are often completely bland, devoid of any social identity, and with fairly strict rules. A frat house provides more personality and freedom. But the MIT dorms have this kind of personality and the rules are pretty lax.  Dorm rooms are tiny and crowded, and a frat house offers more square footage per person. But MIT dorms are relatively spacious, and I think in many cases offer just as much size per person.  The student body is widely varied in personality and interest, as they span the full range of academic subjects. Joining a frat allows you to pick your community and live with people with the same interests. But at MIT almost everyone is in STEM so its all nerds wherever you live. Whatever variance you might be looking for can usually be found scattered around in all living communities. For example, sure, the athletes may gravitate towards Baker, but thats not to say that thats the only place where athletes live or that Baker is just a jock dorm. FWIW, when I was an undergrad, I identified far less cultural difference between frats than between dorms.  Then again, a large fraction of the student body end up in FSILGs, so apparently people see the value. If you find a community you like, then absolutely go for it, but if you dont, then dont, and you shouldnt feel like youre missing out on anything.", "I strongly agree. Find the living community that you love, whether it is an FSILG or dormbased. Being in an FSILG is certainly not a prerequisite for having a fun and exciting time at MIT.

I doubt you can do management consulting with a CS major in the longterm, although it is probably possible for STEM OPT cos USCIS dont really care about that. How it works is that you will submit your application to USCIS, then they inevitably send you a RFE, which means you need to submit additional proof that your studies match your occupation, so you need to hire a lawyer to mark up your transcript  course list and send it into USCIS, and pray for the best.

Vlad and his younger brother,Radu, were held as hostages in theOttoman Empirein 1442 to secure their fathers loyalty. Vlads father and eldest brother,Mircea, were murdered afterJohn Hunyadi, regentgovernor of Hungary, invaded Wallachia in 1447. Hunyadi installed Vlads second cousin,VladislavII, as the new voivode. Hunyadi launched a military campaign against the Ottomans in the autumn of 1448, and Vladislav accompanied him. Vlad broke into Wallachia with Ottoman support in October, but Vladislav returned and Vlad sought refuge in the Ottoman Empire before the end of the year. Vlad went toMoldaviain 1449 or 1450, and later to Hungary.  Relations between Hungary and Vladislav later deteriorated, and in 1456 Vlad invaded Wallachia with Hungarian support. Vladislav died fighting against him. Vlad began a purge among theWallachian boyarsto strengthen his position. He came into conflict with theTransylvanian Saxons, who supported his opponents,DanandBasarab Laiotwho were Vladislavs brothers, and Vladsillegitimatehalfbrother,Vlad the Monk. Vlad plundered the Saxon villages, taking the captured people to Wallachia where he had themimpaledwhich inspired hiscognomen. Peace was restored in 1460.  TheOttoman Sultan,Mehmed II, ordered Vlad to pay homage to him personally, but Vlad had the Sultans two envoys captured and impaled. In February 1462, he attacked Ottoman territory, massacring tens of thousands of Turks and Bulgarians. Mehmed launched a campaign against Wallachia to replace Vlad with Vlads younger brother, Radu. Vladattempted to capture the sultanatTrgoviteduring the night of 1617June 1462. The sultan and the main Ottoman army left Wallachia, but more and more Wallachians deserted to Radu. Vlad went to Transylvania to seek assistance fromMatthias Corvinus,King of Hungary, in late 1462, but Corvinus had him imprisoned.  Vlad was held in captivity inVisegrdfrom 1463 to 1475. During this period, anecdotes about his cruelty started to spread in Germany and Italy. He was released at the request ofStephen III of Moldaviain the summer of 1475. He fought in Corvinuss army against the Ottomans inBosniain early 1476. Hungarian and Moldavian troops helped him to force Basarab Laiot who had dethroned Vlads brother, Radu to flee from Wallachia in November. Basarab returned with Ottoman support before the end of the year. Vlad was killed in battle before 10January 1477. Books describing Vlads cruel acts were among the first bestsellers in the Germanspeaking territories. In Russia, popular stories suggested that Vlad was able to strengthen central government only through applying brutal punishments, and a similar view was adopted by most Romanian historians in the 19th century.

Hospitals serving areas where it is surging have reported admitting more young and middleaged covid19 patients, but that may be because they are less likely to be vaccinated.  Realworld data suggests that all three vaccines authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration offer strong protection against severe disease and death from the delta variant, although they appear to offer less robust protection against minor to moderate infections  A study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the PfizerBioNTech vaccine was 36 percent effective against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant after the first shot of the twoshot regime, but 88 percent effective after the second shot  In terms of preventing hospitalizations from delta, a separate PHE paper suggested that the Pfizer vaccine was 94 percent effective after the first shot and 96 percentile effective after the second  Health experts said that, because the Moderna vaccine uses the same technology as the one from Pfizer, they extrapolate that it offers similar protection  health experts anticipate that it will cause surges in communities where vaccination rates are lower  There is little research on delta symptoms, but some people have reported symptoms such as a headache, sore throat and runny nose, without the hallmark covid19 signs, such as a loss of taste and smell  There is no indication the delta variant is more virulent if it infects childrenHowever, because delta is more contagious than earlier variants, children are at somewhat greater risk of infection  httpswww.washingtonpost.comhealth20210707deltavariantcovid  My opinion on the facts It sounds like if you are vaccinated the delta variant gives you the symptoms of the flua cold. There is no evidence that delta results in more severe cases or deaths among the vaccinated, which all of MIT has to be by 730. Therefore, this mask requirement is not necessary. Additionally, there are no children under the age of 12 running around MIT. The masks were supposed to be a temporary thing. Covid will be with us forever. People have to not be idiots and get the vaccine. However, once they do the data shows we dont need to flip out and reinstate mask requirements. I get that the CDC recommended wearing masks again indoors, but MIT is not the general population where there are idiots who are not vaccinated walking around. We all got the vaccine, let us go back to normal life.  Update 81121  According to MITs email today 0.0008 of vaccinated individuals have a breakthrough infection resulting in death. httpsmedical.mit.educovid19updates202108breakthroughinfections . This number includes the immunocompromised.  Additionally, you may say What about kids They arent vaccinated. Lets look at that data. httpsservices.aap.orgenpages2019novelcoronaviruscovid19infectionschildrenandcovid19stateleveldatareport Key takeaway 0.00 to 0.03 of child COVID19 cases results in deaths.  Now lets compare these numbers to the flu. httpswww.cdc.govfluaboutburdenindex.html In 20192020 22,00038,000,000 flu cases resulted in death. That is 0.05 of flu cases resulting in death. In 20182019 3400036000000  0.09.  We did not wear masks for this 0.05 chance of dying from the flu. And these numbers include the deaths from the immunocompromised. The death numbers from COVID are orders of magnitude less than the flu. Wear a mask if you a germaphobe, but otherwise there is no need.", "Youre missing the part where the vaccinated are exhibiting a similar viral load as the unvaccinated when they contract Delta unlike other varianta.

Just, like, give me some reason to treat you differently than we were treating people bashing lockdowns last year.  If youd come here and presented your data, but concluded, thus, I think MIT will likely lift the mask rules soon after the semester ends, then Id conclude that youre presenting a well reasoned argument. Then, youd be accepting that theres been uncertainty trough this entire process, and that MIT is probably, either through a process held up by bureaucracy or an overabundance of caution both for their own pocketbook, and for the care of the under 18 year old students residing on campus, theyve created a policy that doesnt reflect the leniencies the current science allows.  But, instead, youve gone and called it stupid. No acknowledgement that MIT might be looking at rising case numbers in Middlesex County worriedly. No acknowledgement that maybe MITs concerned that not everybody will be vaccinated, even with a university mandate.

What gives you this impression I understand we like to think of MIT as a paragon of scientific literacy, but let me be the first to tell you that many MIT students make bad decisions. Some are as prone to disinformation campaigns as the rest of our world. There will be students who fake getting vaccinated, and there will be students who show medical reasons for not being able to be vaccinated, and there will be family members of students who are not vaccinated.  Given that, why would MIT think theyre better off than who the CDC is talking to If anything, a college campus is more prone to transmission. Of course, maybe a couple months into the next semester well learn that were all fine, and the masks will come off. But why would MIT think theyre good right now", "There are childcare centers at MIT. There are lots of parents and grandparents who work at MIT who care for children under 12.

My colleague said he could not imagine describing the illness he had experienced as anything other than severehe was unable to do anything for 36 hours and said it was on par with having debilitating food poisoning. But when I asked a couple doctors about this, they disagreed with his ranking. Technically, it sounds like he had a mild bout of COVID19, by strict case definitions, emergency physician andsometime Slate contributorJeremy Samuel Faust wrote to me. Mild does not mean pleasant. In fact, you can have fever, chills, body aches, and feel downright terrible for a week or more and still be categorized as mild.    If the mild cases of COVID that can break through are more severe than the colds we used to accept as a normal consequence of traveling, that is worth being clear about. So, yes Vaccines greatly reduce the severity of illness. But you can still get very sick, in laymans terms. It can be much more than a sniffle. Frankly, the fact that you can get that sick from mild COVID should be yet another reason to avoid getting what doctors call severe COVID.   My colleague was also frustrated by the fact that everyone in his group got sickhe had believed that because they were all vaccinated, perhaps only one person would get ill if they came into contact with the virus. Hanage said that wasnt quite true, either Im not that surprised that breakthrough infections cluster, given the very pronounced clustering of transmission in general, he said. Even if just one person picked it up at the hockey game, they continued to spend time together indoors afterward and experienced sustained exposure.

People in Asia wore masks as a general precaution for colds and flus.  Maybe it is a smarter thing to be more careful about protection than we have been, again, especially in the middle of a pandemic where hundreds of thousands of people have died, some cannot get the vaccine, a super virulent variant it out there, and more mutationsvariants are likely.

While it absolutely is not true that these numbers are out of date, I dont know where you pulled that from, it is valid that these numbers include the months before the Delta variant was prevalent. Therefore, I calculated the death and hospitalization numbers for vaccinated individuals in May, June, and July based on all the data I could find.  Firstly, httpscovid.cdc.govcoviddatatrackervariantproportionshttpscovid.cdc.govcoviddatatrackervariantproportions According to this chart from the CDC, delta variant cases B.1.167.2 made up the majority of US cases as of 73. Therefore, ideally we would only want to calculate the hospitalization and death numbers for July, but I could not find that data for May, June, and July.  httpswww.cdc.govvaccinescovid19healthdepartmentsbreakthroughcases.htmlhttpswww.cdc.govvaccinescovid19healthdepartmentsbreakthroughcases.html As of 82 164,000,000  people have been vaccinated. Of these, 7,101 patients have had a COVID breakthrough infection that required hospitalization. Of these, 1,507 died.  httpswww.cdc.govmmwrvolumes70wrmm7021e3.htmhttpswww.cdc.govmmwrvolumes70wrmm7021e3.htm . Here we see the breakthrough case data for January 1April 30th. Through April 30th, 101,000,000 people had been vaccinated. Of these, 995 patients were hospitalized with a breakthrough infection and 160 died.  We can use these 2 sources to calculate the breakthrough data for May, June, and July. In May, June, and July 6,106 patients were hospitalized and 512 died. These numbers have gone up by about a factor of 3 from the winter months, which is a factor of the Delta variant and of the pool of vaccinated individuals increasing by 63,000,000.  Finally, the hospitalization and death rates in May, June, and July. 6106164000000  0.003 hospitalization rate and 512164000000  0.0003 death rate.  So that hospitalization and death rates among the vaccinated with the delta variant are higher, but still insignificant. Just slightly higher than the 0.003 and 0.0008 percent reported by MIT for all breakthrough cases since data recording began.  The kid death rates are also up to date it says at the top of the page the numbers are based on cases through 8521  As of the possible long term side effects. Yes, maybe, but there are risks about everything. There is no data that shows this to be any real risk. Additionally, the CDC does not mention long term side effects as a reason they updated their mask wearing guidance. httpscontextcdn.washingtonpost.comnotesproddefaultdocuments54f57708a5294a339a44b66d719070d9note7335c3ab06ee4121aaffa11904e68462.page1httpscontextcdn.washingtonpost.comnotesproddefaultdocuments54f57708a5294a339a44b66d719070d9note7335c3ab06ee4121aaffa11904e68462.page1 Slide 22.

Vaccine Requirement  MITs vaccine requirement has helped lift vaccination coverage in our oncampus community  among students, staff, faculty, and affiliates  to nearly 90.

Two full days remain to satisfy the July 30 vaccine deadline. For those who have completed their vaccinations, we sincerely thank you for your contribution to keeping yourself and others safe.  If you have not yet uploaded proof of vaccination to covidvaccine.mit.edu, completed the student exemption form or the employee exemption form Touchstone required, or contacted vaccinerequirementmit.edu to indicate that you will not be able to meet the deadline, we urge you to act now.  All community members who have not responded by the end of the day on Friday, July 30, will lose access to campus buildings after Sunday, August 1.  Indoor Face Covering and Eating Restrictions Remain in Place  As a result of changing public health conditions and guidance, the Institute will not be lifting some of the restrictions that we announced would be lifted effective July 30.  MIT will continue to require face coverings to be worn inside campus buildings until further notice, and masks will remain mandated in specific spaces required by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, such as MIT shuttle buses.  There are exceptions to this policy, including for faculty and instructional staff when they are teaching residents when they are alone in residential common areas or alone or with their roommates or suitemates in their rooms employees when they are alone in their workspaces and when anyone is eating or drinking.  Additionally, the Institutes June 7 indoor eating policy, which limits group size and time spent eating together, also remains in effect until further notice. Capacity in MITs dining halls will be reduced for the start of the semester, and students will be encouraged to get takeout and eat outdoors.  We will regularly assess the public health situation and adjust our policies as appropriate.  Whats Next Moving Forward with Full Operations  The combination of our communitys high vaccination rate, our ongoing testing program, and continuation of our masking and dining policies gives us confidence in our plan to fully return to inperson learning, teaching, and working. By relying on these protections, our experience managing the campus during the past 16 months, and our communitys flexibility and good will, we believe we can safely live with the virus.

Im a rising senior. My math training is not very related to CS, Ive done an REU in graph theory. However, Im interested in machine learningAIcryptography and am considering graduating a semester late so I can double major in CS instead. This would allow me to get an MEng adding on another year and a half on top of the extra semester. MIT is amazing for CS and Im sort of regretting not spending more time exploring our resources. Right now, I dont have the GPA or research experience to get into anywhere like a top 5 for a CS PhD, so I think this might be my only chance to explore these opportunities.   But that takes me out of the job market for another semester at least and my parents dont think its worth it. If I were going to just do software engineering, Id agree, but I suspect I might be interested in something more researchbased or that requires more advanced coursework. Thoughts", "Its likely not worth it from a software engineering career standpoint, but it sounds like you want to do it partly for opening up the possibility of industry  academia research roles, in which case it may or may not be worth it.  But, given that you cant immediately start your MEng which means you still have to pay tuition and dont get the RA stipend, I think it may make more sense to apply for masters programs at schools where being an undergraduate in the department isnt a requirement e.g. CMU I think, assuming you can find an RA position with some advisor there.", " But that takes me out of the job market for another semester at least and my parents dont think its worth it. If I were going to just do software engineering, Id agree, but I suspect I might be interested in something more researchbased or that requires more advanced coursework.

Could you start working, then use your time in industry to figure out if you want further education or if it is even necessary to reach your professional goals", "I was in a similar boat with a physics major and a cs minor. For just one extra semester, I could get a double major, it seemed amazing  But then you realize that means an extra semester of tuition and housing. It also means you miss out on 36 months of a regular salaried pay. And delaying your professional career also delays promotions, raises, etc. by the same amount of time. It can also be trickier lining up a position when you graduate in the Fall.  And in return, you get...a piece of paper that says major instead of minor. Definitely not worth it. Take the important classes in which you are interested during the next two semesters while you are here. You wont be missing anything except a word on your resume.", "Thanks  Part of me was thinking that a masters at a different school might not be as good as staying at MIT given the research opportunities. Obviously Im not a big fan of paying tuition but I think Id have to for a masters at other schools too.", "Six months or even twelve are nothing in the grand scheme of life. Im not in your or OPs academic field, so I cant comment on your specific situation, but I wouldnt let something like being six months behind in promotions dissuade you from doing something you though was worthwhile.

So yeah, I could see staying at MIT making sense if you can finish up the coursework in the ninth semester and are relatively confident that youd want to explore research for at least the duration of a masters degree of course you should have until next summer to decide, so in the meantime Id recommend exploring UROPs in CSAIL.

It certainly helps to graduate from MIT, but the effect is not as large as 1 grades, 2 research experience, 3 coursework, 4 letters of recommendation. There are many students who graduate from colleges that are much lower ranked than MIT who end up at top programs including MIT because they are very strong along these dimensions.   Youre only a rising junior, you have tons of time. Try to improve your grades and seek out research experience.", "I got into my PhD program with a 4.15.", "Recommendation letters are more important than grades, especially recommendation letters coming from people who worked with you in a research context.   If you dont have a UROP, get one. Do it for credit, if you can. Most professors grade super easy for UROPs, so you can improve your GPA with relative ease. Also plan to work at your UROP next summer. Does your program have a 5th year masters, like the MEng If so, do it, ideally continuing your UROP work. These will be excellent sources of recommendation letters. They will also give you an idea of what grad school is like and whether or not you actually want to be there.   If you are super dedicated to grad school and dont get in where you want the first time around, you can further bolster your application strength by taking a year working as a research assistant.

I didnt get in anywhere I applied sadly. I may try again in the future, but Ive given up on grad school for now. Best of luck raising your GPA", "I wasnt an MIT undergrad large state school but did have very poor grades halfway through undergrad and went on to eventually get into competitive programs. Grades are important but not the entire picture as others are saying. Also, an upward trajectory looks good. If you messed up, that is in the past now, finish strong and that will reflect well on you.", "Your freshman year is likely mostly PNR, so doesnt contribute to GPA.  That means as a rising junior, you have one year of classes to influence your GPA.  With one more year, your overall GPA after 3 years will be midway in between.  So if you have a GPA of 4 for sophomore year, and 5 for junior year, thats 4.5.  4.5 should be fine enough as long as youre strong in other aspects.", "This is a great comment. I had a reasonable but not incredible GPA 4.3 but I also had research experience, a portfolio that outlined my application of my coursework, and very strong letters of recommendation from professors who had really understood my journey at MIT. My poorer grades were the result of health reasons and financial insecurities that I mentioned briefly in my personal statement.  What became the determining factor for a lot of my applications was the alignment of my research interests with professors who had funding for me. All the schools I was accepted to and offered funding for was due to me reaching out to the professor, their staff, or their graduate students and expressing a clear interest in their work and how I could contribute to it. Im currently at my top choice lab.   You have plenty of time.

I wonder what percentage of current students are even aware that the Athena dialup service exists.

You cant just paint murals in other colleges dorms, and you probably cant do a good portion of the things that are typical to MIT culture in most other schools.

Theres also something to be said for deliberately cultivating charisma such that you can get people on board with your schemes. In my experience, people in just about any culture will try something new if theres a likable person recruiting them who seems to know what theyre doing.

Also, given the interdisciplinary nature of the field, it would be a bitstrange to offer only a masters in it since there are many many skills and components of knowledge you need to procure, which are better served by getting a masters in a more specific skill set like computer science or statistics or specialty like immunology which can then be applied towards a neuro or cognitive science oriented field.   Also, the BCS department and field in general itself is so wide and varied so theres no way to offer a unified masters curriculum without excluding a large faction of the kind of researchwork done by the labs. There is no onesizefitsall foundation level of skillsideas for brain and cognitive science.   To answer your main question an undergrad degree gives you the opportunity to explore such a wide variety of fields  ranging from artificial intelligence, physics, molecular biology, psycholinguistics, developmental cognitive neuroscience. Its a great jumpstart for someone with a curiosity about not only how our mindsbrains work, but also someone with an interest in modeling intelligence, whether it be natural or computational. At the same time, I think its better suited for someone who is interested in pursuing researchfurther education in the future even if not necessarily in neuro or cognitive science rather than an endall beall undergrad degree which you might hope will be a ticket towards several job opportunities at least not without double majoring in something else.

Certain contractors and others working on campus, or accessing MIT facilities in Cambridge, must also be vaccinated. For staff represented by a union, MITs labor relations team will continue discussions with union leadership about this requirement.  Exemptions to this requirement may be granted for medical or religious reasons, or for staff who are approved to work remotely fulltime.  Just as with our vaccine requirement for enrolled students, we are taking this step in keeping with the vision for a safe return to full operations that President Reif outlined in March. Below, we explain more about how the requirement will be implemented, as well as our approach to testing for Covid19 at the beginning of the fall. We also offer other key updates about what to expect this fall as MIT prepares to fully emerge from the pandemics long shadow.  Vaccine requirement   A few weeks ago, we wrote that we were considering implementing a vaccine requirement for employees and others. We ultimately decided to move forward with such a requirement based on our understanding of the science behind the vaccines, their established safety and efficacy, and their wide availability across the state and country.   We will accept all vaccines that have received either Emergency Use Authorization or final approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, as well as those vaccines with an emergency use listing from the World Health Organization. Proof of your vaccination must be submitted using Covid Vaccine in the Atlas mobile app or at covidvaccine.mit.edu. Access to this information will be limited, as provided in the Covid Pass privacy statement. MIT feels that it is necessary to have this information in order to monitor the level of vaccination in our community and to take measures to mitigate or respond to any outbreaks.  Beginning today, Covid19 vaccination is required for community members seeking to participate in MITsponsored international or domestic travel, unless the traveler has an approved medical or religious exemption.  Our vaccine requirements will strengthen our collective protection against the virus and its variants, and increase our communitys comfort with a return to full operations. And it will better position us to ease many of MITs Covidera restrictions and limitations  so that together, we can continue to fulfill the Institutes academic and research mission, and restore vibrant life and activity to our campus.  A preview of fall policies  While 21 of MIT community members expected to be on campus in the fall have not yet reported their vaccine status, 91 of those who are accessing campus right now have indicated they are already fully or partially vaccinated. As our vaccine requirements take effect, we can begin to focus on adjusting our Covidera policies. And as more members of our community become protected against the virus, we will be in a position to relax many of the restrictions that have defined campus for over a year.  While many decisions still need to be made, here is a preview of what to expect in four key areas  Testing in the fall  To gain an early understanding of our communitys health, MIT will initially require any community member accessing campus buildings to receive a Covid test once per week. MIT Medical is developing an unobserved, selfadministered testing system for the fall so the process will be quick and easy to integrate into our routines.  We will regularly evaluate whether it is necessary to continue widespread community testing throughout the fall. If public health data indicate that testing is no longer needed, we will stop. And we will always be prepared to ramp up our testing if we see an uptick in virus prevalence in our community or in the surrounding communities.  Individuals who work on campus and are exempt from the vaccine requirements for medical or religious reasons may be required to comply with additional requirements, including more frequent testing and mask wearing.  Return to work and Work Succeeding  Faculty and staff who worked on campus before the pandemic, and who have not yet returned to campus, have been told to plan for resuming inperson work by September 7, 2021. More information about what inperson work will look like will be shared by local managers in the coming weeks, but faculty and staff should be in the area and prepared for inperson teaching, meetings, and other types of work by that date, as required by individual units.   At the same time, the Work Succeeding effort to define new ways of working is well underway. This initiative is creating guidelines and policies to support working together more flexibly and effectively. You can expect more information about this work in the coming weeks.  Campus access, visitors, and events in the fall  In addition to the fall marking the return of inperson work and learning, we expect the campus to open up again to the MIT community. Buildings will be easier to access than they were during the pandemic for community members who are in compliance with our vaccine and testing requirements. Covidera capacity limits will be lifted in classrooms, offices, and other campus spaces. And going forward, we envision systems and measures to allow us to safely welcome guests and visitors in residence halls, on admissions tours, and at campus events, meetings, workshops, and sporting competitions. We do not know yet whether additional visiting appointments such as visiting students and scholars will remain paused for fall as we increase the population of our own community on campus.  We are also working to make selected areas of the campus open to the public again.   Responding to state and municipal plans to lift Covid19 restrictions   In light of the ongoing success of state and city vaccination efforts, as well as new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Massachusetts and Cambridge officials have rescinded their remaining Covid policies, effective May 29, 2021. While MIT has the latitude to set its own Covid rules, we would like to be in step with the state and city  but we still need to allow members of our community a little more time to get vaccinated. In the coming weeks, we anticipate relaxing our remaining policies, including permitting individuals who are fully vaccinated to go without their face coverings on campus. However, members of the community who prefer to wear masks in certain settings will be encouraged and welcome to do so.        We will be hosting two community town halls  one for faculty, staff, and postdocs, and one for students  later this month to help answer your questions about the vaccine requirements and other aspects of our summer and fall planning. Watch for invitations in the coming days, and stay updated by regularly checking MIT Now, or watching your inbox for the MIT Forward, for the latest policies, FAQs, and more.  The past 15 months have seen our community come together to contend with the losses, sacrifices, fears, and 247 demands of a global pandemic. Fortunately its now time to set our collective sights on a hopeful future, and to look forward to the fall and a safe return to full operations.

I have several years of work experience doing energy engineering and while I have learned a lot, this field is not for me. So, Im going back to school for CEE because thats where my passion always was in undergrad and I genuinely want to broaden my knowledge on the subject. However, lately Ive also been reassessing the notion that I want to do engineering at all as a longterm career. I enjoy the more tangiblebig picture side of problem solving and it seems like so many engineering jobs including my own are hyper focused on the same narrow and repetitive tasks that never really return any value for me personally. Because of this, Ive considering consulting or maybe something adjacent. Ive seen the stats that say something like 35 of alums end up going into financeconsultingprof services. Im not really worried since a technical degree like engineering is pretty easy to market in other fields if I do decide to pursue a different career. Im just interested in hearing what other peoples experiences have been with finding jobs and whether or not those jobs aligned with your passions.", "This is my extremely biased and very controversial viewpoint, read it as just another random anecdote  As a course 1 myself, I can perhaps shed some light on this. The roles that have been offered to me are extremely narrow, and the work is very repetitive and require very little imagination to be frank. Most of it can be categorized as busywork, since it involves just following a bunch of codes. There is little wiggle room to make things truly happen, you spend the rest of the waking hours doing things that have little importance and most key decisions are driven in a topdown fashion. Apart from that, things are fairly standardized read boring, including dress codes even on nonfield days, sitting for FE, acquiring a PE, the drudgery goes on. This isnt why I went to MIT, I couldve gone to a state school and that had been just as good. The only way people make any money in the field is if they start their own consulting practice, and believe me it is just paper pushing at that point.  My friends from Course 6, 15, 16 have fared significantly better. Mostly because there are still plenty of niches within those fields that are relatively new read not strictly regulated. Their daytoday work also seems much more interesting and monetarily rewarding. My peers in Course 1 have either shifted to MBB within couple of years in the industry, or have gone on to get a law degree or an MBA to pivot to Finance, Product Managers in big tech, or Strategists at F500. Heck look at most new professors in CEE at MIT, almost none of them are CEE undergrads themselves not saying this is bad thing.  If I had to do it all over, I would be a Course 6 63 specifically.

Nothing like building your own company for engaging the big picture that you mentioned, and youll have a live or die impact as opposed to consulting, which only rarely provides you such thrillsnightmares.  so tldr advice is something like You are going to be pretty well set up to position yourself anywhere on the spectrum of the pure engineering to big picture, so go out and have at it.", "ChemE here.

This vaccine is NOT FDA approved, only emergency use authorized. This means it has been authorized for use in preventing, treating, or curing serious illnesses. For people in our age group and even up to 4050, this is not a serious illness.  Regardless, I dont think its right to force people to get a treatment that hasnt even been approved by the FDA. We have no idea what the longterm effects are.  I want to make it clear that I am not antivaxx. I have received all other immunizations and gladly get the flu vaccine every year. However, this is because these treatments have been fully tested and approved for use.  Furthermore, I am already in the process of getting the vaccine for personal reasons.  Is there anything we can do to fight back against this I am staunchly opposed to the idea of requiring the vaccine for others. I feel like if we heard that an institution of any sort was forcing people to get an experimental treatment, we would be outraged. Why is this any different  x200B  Edit Wanted to add to the conversation with great points others have brought up  1. This can be a serious illness for many of our age Although I still dont think it fully constitutes a serious illness, please read the one comment citing some sources regarding the severity of COVID19 in young populations. 2.

With regards to the second article hospitalizations and adverse outcomes and fourth article, is it not reasonable that those who are hospitalized are at a higher rate of adverse outcomes by virtue of hospitalization I would expect that if you are hospitalized due to COVID19 that you are likely going to have adverse outcomes anyways. What is true is that it seems that many who are completely healthy fall very ill, in which case it is reckless to assume that youthfulness equals safety from COVID19   With regards to the third article, it brings up that 13 of young adults may face severe COVID19 infection as a result of comorbidities such as smoking and obesity. If this is the case, would it not be more fair to require vaccinations of those who are at risk of severe illness as opposed to all populations Of course, there are those populations who have immune disorders, diabeters diabetes, etc. and Im not sure of the safety of vaccination for them given their comorbidities which comes back to agreeing with your point regarding herd immunity for those that cannot get vaccinated  x200B  Edit spelling", "Of course, I never said the requirement was infringing any rights whatsoever.

What Im suggesting is that, is it reasonable to require students to get a treatment of any sort, we can generalize this to any treatment, not just a specific circumstance vaccine that has not officially received FDA approval     Normally for EUA, patients are NOT required to get the treatment. It is made available to them if they wish to get it because no other viable alternative exists. It is their prerogative whether or not they wish to receive the treatment. This is the case for COVID19, and the EUA is completely justified because there is no COVID19 vaccine.

To the members of the MIT community,  Holidays are facts on a calendar with practical effects in our lives and our work  and they are also resonant symbols of what we honor, celebrate and value. This dual role means that, for a community that encompasses as many cultures as MIT, altering the schedule of holidays takes thoughtful consultation.  Last summer, I asked Institute Community and Equity Officer John Dozier and Vice President for Human Resources Ramona Allen to reexamine our roster of Institute holidays with an eye to equity and inclusion. That process led us last fall to rename our longstanding October holiday as Indigenous Peoples Day.  Recently, after consulting widely with community members across the Institute, the working group that Ramona and John created recommended that MIT should designate a new Institute holiday for Juneteenth. Traditionally celebrated on June 19th, this holiday marks the moment in 1865 when the people held in slavery in Texas were finally told  two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation  that they were legally free.   I am delighted to let you know that we will adopt Juneteenth as an Institute holiday starting this summer.  Because June 19th falls this year on a Saturday, it will be observed as an Institute holiday on Friday, June 18th. Human Resources will follow up by email to administrators about pay policies, including how to report time for this closing.  Embracing Juneteenth as one of our Institute holidays demonstrates that even things as fixed as the Institute calendar can change in response to learning and growth. Setting aside this day serves to acknowledge the stain on our nation of centuries of slavery. It also encourages us to reflect on the long shadow of that institution and to appreciate the ongoing struggle of Black Americans for equity, inclusion and justice. Recognizing the significance of this date in American history and taking the time to pause and deepen our understanding benefits us all.   I hope it will also be a beautiful day for the human connection and rest we all need.  With gratitude  With thanks to the many employees who contributed feedback throughout this process, I offer special gratitude to Ramona and John for their leadership, and to the chair of the Holidays Working Group, Alyce Johnson, and all its members, who took such care in weighing the options.

There were a lot of angry feelings about this because it was understood that NV would start off as a swing dorm while other buildings got renovated so MIT could keep residents together and cultures alive.

Well, eventually the time came for that BC renovation. When they announced that BC would close summer 2020 they also made it clear that NV would no longer be a swing dorm, but instead be its own thing so as not to interfere with it developing its own culture.

To members of the MIT community,  As we look toward the fall semester and a return to more inperson work and learning on campus, were writing with an important update on our approach to community health and wellbeing.  Following consultation with medical experts, consideration of best public health practices, a review of how other institutions of higher education are approaching vaccine requirements, and guidance from the American College Health Association, MIT will require all students to be fully vaccinated for Covid19 in order to register for the fall semester. Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart and MIT Medical Director Cecilia Stuopis wrote to students with this update on Friday.  We are still considering whether to pursue a similar requirement for MIT staff, faculty, and others who routinely access campus. To help us make an informed decision, all employees are required to complete a vaccination status form using our secure platform by May 23. This requirement applies to all employees, whether you are accessing campus or not. It also applies to all contractors and other workers who routinely access campus. If you are in Covid Pass and have not responded by May 23, you will be prompted for this information before you can access campus.  Your vaccine status will only be accessible by authorized MIT Medical and supporting staff in accordance with our privacy and data retention policies. Aggregated vaccine data, such as the percentage of MIT employees vaccinated or planning to get vaccinated, will be used to help us make decisions about fall policies, including testing, mask requirements, and the possibility of employee vaccine requirements. Aggregated data may also be shared with the community to make clear the factors that inform our final decisions.  While the vaccine status information we are requiring from you is only being used in the aggregate right now, in the future individualized data may be used for health and safety purposes to, for example, determine your eligibility to access certain spaces and activities on campus, or for MITsponsored travel.   It is important to keep in mind that as the vaccination rate within our community increases, the need for restrictions to keep our community safe decreases.   Whatever decision we make with regard to employee vaccinations, it will be focused on ensuring that we can safely fulfill our mission. As President Reif recently announced, we are planning to offer a complete and compelling oncampus experience this fall. We recognize, of course, that the way we work together is evolving, which is why our Work Succeeding effort is so important. The recommendations of that initiative will be woven tightly together with our plans for health and safety on campus this fall.    Getting the formula right will require all of us to play a role  starting with completing the vaccination status form by May 23.  In the meantime, thank you for everything you continue to do to make MIT an extraordinary place.   Sincerely,  Ramona Allen, Vice President for Human Resources  Martin A. Schmidt, Provost  Glen Shor, Executive Vice President and Treasurer     P.S. If you havent already, please get vaccinated as soon as you can to protect yourself and those around you", "Im presuming youre coming from another country.  Given that some of the vaccines arent that effective open secret, its probably in you and everyones best interest to get a new vaccination when you get here.

How does the general double majoring process even look like If you have any advice, Id love to hear it", "10b7a Double major here. Graduated 13 years ago. If I went back, I would not double major. I would spend more time in my UROP lab instead.  You forget what you learn in classes pretty quickly after you graduate. What you learn in your UROP stays with you for the rest of your life. Also companies or grad schools do not care about double majors. A higher GPA would take you further.", "Thats totally doable. However, Id suggest really exploring your interests and making sure you think double majoring and confining yourself to a rigid set of classes is worth it. My friend who was course 17 regrets it, I think its one of those majors where the degree track may not be as meaningful as just taking the course 17 classes you like.   If you do decide to double, theres a form you have to fill out and get approved by a committee. Usually pretty straightforward. Keep an eye on unrestricted electives, you may need them.", "Double majoring is possible, but its important to remember that a 614 major means youre not going to be able to take as many 17 courses, and a 17 major means you wont be able to take as many 614 courses. If the particular ratio demanded by 61417 is your a priori choice or close enough, then definitely take it. If you find the ratio off, you can always focus on one and call the other a concentration.  My typical advice is to take the classes you like to through Junior Fall, and then figure out what major those become.", "Using very pulled out of the air numbers, double majoring means 50 more work for 10 more return.  Youre already getting a degree from MIT, having a second major really isnt going to help you in life", "6318 here. Its very feasible. With the amount those two overlap you can easily do it in four years and probably wont have to take more than four classes per semester.  Youre going to change and grow so much in your freshman year though that youll laugh at how much energy you put into asking questions like these. So dont sweat it too much.", "The problem is, yes, in theory, you could make all the class requirements for 614 and 17 fit into your fouryear plan and schedule. However, it may not be the most optimal choice in the long run.   Right now, as a prefrosh, you dont have a good judgement of time commitment for classes, especially the ones targeted to upperclassmen. Furthermore, that extra time in those classes outside of the minimum to graduate, is time you could have used to work on a UROP, or some sort of engineering teamclub etc. And you wont have a good sense of what activities are even available until at least the activities fair.  And what if you discover a cool class in other departments you want to take You will want to have enough room in your schedule for those.  Double majoring doesnt really earn you any extra points you wont get more brownie points from professors or recruiters compared to a kickass GPA, and it doesnt get you extra badass points with alumni or older students. ALWAYS pick higher GPA  deeper competence in a subject material over double majoring.  However, IF you are still sold on trying to double major, then heres the advice. Try as hard as possible to find classes that can fulfill requirements in both majors, even if you have to petition it. Some double major combos are more popular than others precisely because the massive overlap of certain material, such as 6318, or 618, makes the petition very easy.", "Doubles really depend on the course. 18 is known as an easy double because it has very flexible requirements for example.

One thing that is nice about this major is that its easy to transition out of. For better or for worse I think its worse, your econ classes can count towards your HASS requirement, so if you dont end up liking econ, those classes can still count for something.

Grad classes are pretty much completely open to undergrads you might need to meet with the professor briefly so they can verify that you have the technical maturity for their class, and quite a few highlevel undergrad classes are either grad classes or ones that graduate students are taking.  I mention this because with composite majors, you might not have the opportunity to develop the maturity in one half of the major to take some of these highlevel classes.

At the beginning of the semester that I took 867, we were given an assessment of the prerequisite knowledge for the class. It was about probability, linear algebra, and basic ML.

I know virtually nothing about FSILGs, so could someone please give me a list of pros and cons of living in one, especially for an international who is quite introverted", "It will heavily depend on the FSILG. But since youve mentioned its coed, that narrows it down to only a few possibilities. All of the coed ones I know of had lively culture and nice people during my time.  In general, a big difference will be freedom. MIT is increasingly moving in the direction of making dorms homogeneous and sterile. Even before the pandemic they were increasing rules and regulations in dorms and constantly making decisions directly contradicting students wants and needs. In an FSILG, MIT has way less of a say in what goes on. Each house pretty much makes their own rules and has very little MIT oversight. This may sound harsh, but personally I feel that in dorms, MIT is treating undergrads like children. In a more independent environment like an FSILG, I felt like more of an adult.   Other pros  most if not all FSILGs are cheaper than dorm pricing  much better food options. If you end up somewhere with an inhouse meal plan those can be great and usually like a third of the price of campus meal plans  FSILG alumni communities tend to be tighter knit and have a stronger presence than in dorms. This can be really helpful for mentoring and stuff.  Cons  depending on the FSILG, distance to campus. Though that may be a pro though if you want some space or want to be in Boston", "Im feeling a little salty this morning, so these are my thoughts as someone who is antigreek life.  But as the other poster said, the coed FSILGs are unique in what I feel is a positive way.  Pros   You get easy access to alcohol and fake IDs because you will have friends who are 21 who are willing to take part in illegal activities to make your college experience more fun.  You are more likely to get opportunities like internships, jobs or competitive spots in clubs because people in your FSILG will advocate for you.  You might have access to course bibles that will make it easier to get good grades in your classes.  Its easier to coordinate taking classes with other people in your FSILG, so you have a builtin study group.  Cons  The rush process is super judgemental.  Ive heard it being compared to dating, and it kind of is tbh, which means you might also experience things like ghosting, breadcrumbing, and hot and cold behavior.  During the rush process, people will have heated discussions about who you are a person to decide whether or not you should receive a bid.  I have a lot of friends, none of them have ever spent anywhere close to the amount of time the various fraternities did evaluating my personality.  In most cases, the rush process is biased towards fraternities and sororities.  Many fraternities and sororities will only accept freshman, and the usual rush process is right after orientation when you are still getting used to MIT.  Even if you do your part in making sure your rush and recruitment process if fair, you will still have to deal with your national organization.  For example, Alpha Phi manipulated sororities all over the nation into using appearance as a factor in recruitment see httpsdocs.google.comdocumentd1JQfuIA0lx5PHf3VFDhQ8STnR1QWpMNI0G7Z6xthshRMedit for details.  I suspect this was the case at MIT also.  Joining a FSLIG will make it easier for people to stereotype you.

I really liked my single because I could go out or have people over as much as I wanted when I wanted, but also have the ability to have a quiet and private workspace when I wanted. You cant really guarantee that with roommates. In EC, there is always something going on down the hall, so youre not going to get bored or lonely.   Kitchens ECspecific they can get crowded during peak dinner time, but not really in a way that prevents you from cooking. You just have to share space and coordinate a little.

I love math and science, but Im also interested in history.  I like MIT a lot, but Im scared I wont develop the soft skills I need in life in case I want to move up in the business world or in the world of nonprofits. In addition, Ive spent the majority of my high school just studying.

You will definitely have opportunities to practice those soft skills at MIT, but you do need to seek it out a bit more. Theres a fairly large social divide between like Baker house and Greek life, and then everyone else. As far as being able to go into the city and all, Stanford doesnt really have that so much. Its very spread out and feels kind of suburban. As far as being low income and first gen, I was both of those coming into MIT and I felt very welcomed and MITs financial aid office is filled with some of the most patient and understanding people out there.

If youre unsure about STEM, Harvard or Stanford might be better that said, at MIT you can crossregister for classes at Harvard. However, if the primary concern is business acumen, I wouldnt be too worried. MIT has a great business school where you can take classes, and I have never had any problems being wellconnected via MIT. If youre serious about business youll probably need to do an MBA someday anyway, so any of the three excellent undergrad institutions will be fine.    That said, I feel like there is a lot more rich person vibe at Stanford. Lots of expensive cars with custom plates. The city of Palo Alto is also extremely affluent. I never got that feeling at MIT. Regarding location, youll probably go out more being in Cambridge. Harvard and MIT are very close to city attractions, and if you stay out late rideshare is cheap. At Stanford you will be 40 miles from San Francisco, which is at best a 45 minute drivetrain ride....and the trains stop at midnight and rideshare for 40 miles is not cheap.  Some may argue that you might have more free time at Stanford, but from my experience the coursework seems equally challenging at Stanford and MIT, so unless you have other reasons to think youll have more free time out west, Id prioritize an urban campus if you want to enjoy city life and eating out.

Protip most people at MIT take a standard courseload, even if the vocal minority whines about how much work they have with their ridiculous 6class load ", "Im a bit late here. But worklife balance mostly depends on you. If youre getting in, Im certain you will do just fine. There are many students who are totally new taking the class as well. I dont think classes in CS are harder at MIT than Stanford. The key difference at MIT, I believe, is that it allows you to make it as challenging as you want, meaning taking a very advanced rigorous class, graduate course, or go to labs doing research with PhDs, you name it. That kind of early professional development is great opportunity but how you approach it is totally up to you. Most students who go out of the way to do so want to do PhD afterward anyway. Also, the first semester has no grade so you can adjust as you go and find your comfortable mileage.   For your interests, Im not really sure Course 1 is fit for NASA, try AeroAstro instead Therere a lot of MIT alums at NASA, check their Martian pagehttpsmars.nasa.govpeoplecategorymars2020 for example.

About softskill especially business related, you will have no problem developing them at MIT with wide access to Sloan courses and professional development program. Sloan is much more open to undergrad than HBS and Stanford GSB, youll have chance to take classes, doing project with MBA, MFin students. Networkings not a problem, youll have chance to talk to many, even with Executive MBAs. The only thing that I find MIT somewhat lacking is a class on psychology side that available for undergrad think of Yales psychology of happiness class. Anyway, soft skill is a lifelong and practiceoriented project. Many of said skills are taught in Grad schools you can take it at Sloan but generally youll need working experience to fully immerse yourself in case studies. Feel free to DM me about that or FGLI experience.

Our math program is obviously outstanding, and your course of study is extremely flexible. You can go more on the pure math side abstract algebra, topology, number theory, etc., more on the applied side statistics, computation, linear algebra and various applications or a mix thereof.   These two departments also blend together quite well, either through the 142 major or if you wanted to double major.   A final advantage of MIT is that while the department is relatively large in terms of faculty, the number of undergrads majoring in Econ is very small, so you get great faculty engagement.   Overall, both schools obviously have great math and economics programs, and academically, you really couldnt go wrong with either one. To anyone making this choice, Id recommend MIT because I like the culture better, but of course Im a bit biased. Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions.", "I really cant speak for Harvard, but my friend who studies mathematical economics tells me that MIT econ students are different from ones at other schools because a greater proportion of them go on to study econ in grad school instead of going into finance or consulting. I also believe the econ program at MIT is pretty mathoriented.", "As others have mentioned, the two schools are very different and so are their econ curricula. At Harvard, it will be easier to graduate with a high GPA the courses, in general, will be easier and it will be easier to get good grades.", "As an Econ alum, Id second a lot of what was said here. If there are key classes you want to take at one school vs another, you can always crossregister something I did plenty of. Id go with where you think youll have a better cultural fit, and happy to answer any questions you have.  Another thing might be to look for people who studied undergrad at one and grad at another a few friends pop immediately to mind, theyd be folks with a valuable perspective too.", "Bathrooms in MIT", "Hello there, Ive heard a lot about a bathroom situation at MIT and I have a question about them  Are there bathrooms in the actual rooms Not the entire dorm area as a whole just the actually sleeping space.", "i think one of the dormsbaker has a sink in their room and another dormsimmons has more private bathrooms that 23 people share but I dont think they are in the actual sleeping areas", "Yeah every seperate room has a seperate washroom", "EC also has sinks in rooms.", "Some rooms in Simmons have bathrooms inside of them but you are in charge of cleaning them.", "Are the dorms with bathrooms that 23 people share a suitelike arrangement", "the ones in simmons, no its more like a bathroom assigned to up to 3 people, but macgregor and a couple others maybe have apartmentlike suites with their own bathrooms and kitchens", "Do students supply their own kitchen items or the university Like, pans, cooking utensils, etc", "Are there any MIT external transfers I could talk to", "I wanna ask some questions to you guys about MIT. i wanna hopefully study at Sloan and learn about the social stuff at MIT. Just let me know if I can DM you questions. And also can you guys give me suggestions on where else to connect with MIT transfers Thanks", "Where do grad student live", "Hi, Im an incoming grad student and I was wondering where most of the current one live   More especially, would commuting from porter square viable or would you recommend finding a place closer  Thanks", "People live all over Cambridge and parts of Boston if they dont live on campus. Porter is a really great location for a grad student youll probably be able to get wherever you need to get to on campus in less than 30 minutes. There are plenty of places closer as the crow flies which have a longer actual commute and which are harder to live in in terms of what sorts of other things youll have access to.", "On the red line north of the city is a good choice Porter included if you can find a place thats affordable.  Im partial to Davis Square myself, but Tufts is nearby and may push up student style apartment costs.  The Green Line extension is not likely to be open and operating before you get your degree if you are just starting a SM or PhD, but soonish Union Square will be on a subway and likely interesting.", "Being near the T is useful for going to the airport but for daily travel not so much.  Compared to biking, taking the T is both expensive and timeconsuming driving is even more expensive, and parking is troublesome. Within about 10 miles, biking takes less time than driving once you take parking and walking into account.   On the other hand, on cold rainy windy days, biking over bridges is miserable. Having an alternative on those days, even if its walking, is welcome.   As for where to live, anyplace nearby is fine. Central Square, Tech Square, Inman Square, Cambridgeport, Porter Square, East Cambridge would have more grad students. Somerville, Fresh Pond, Arlington, Boston, Allston have fewer, though theyre reasonable choices. Back Bay, Harvard Square, and Beacon Hill are expensive.", "Where people collect rent", "Lived in porter right behind the star market for 3 years.  Would recommend.   The supermarket used yo be 247 which was convenient, now its up to midnight I think which is still okay. The T is just around the corner. Then you have a bunch of restaurants closeby yume wo katare, all the Japanese shops in the Lesley student center, dakzen etc.  all of Davis Sq which is basically walking distance"]
