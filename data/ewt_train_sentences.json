reasonable to credit his statement that he got the lesion after bumping into a suitcase he was carrying at a camp in Afghanistan.", "The lesion is further evidence of Al Qaeda's anthrax production program at Kandahar.", "The present evidence relating to Atta's alleged travel to Prague does not warrant a conclusion that Al Qaeda obtained the Ames strain from Iraq.", "Iraq, however, remains a possible source of the Ames.", "Former Russian bioweaponeer Ken Alibek has said that a key Russian scientist assisted Iraq and that Russia had the Ames strain.", "(His conclusion may have been based on the fake mobile biolab plans foisted upon the US by the Chalabi associate \"Curveball\", which Alibek divined to be identical to Russian mobile lab design).", "Zawahiri did travel to Baghdad in 1998 with an entourage to attend the birthday party of Saddam's son.", "The papers found at headquarters of the Mukhabarat, Iraq's secret police, show that an entourage from Al Qaeda group was sent to the Iraqi capital in March 1998 from Sudan.", "According to at least some reports, Bin Laden rejected the suggestion of a closer alliance -- preferring to pursue his own concept of jihad.", "Two top Iraqi scientists, code named Charlie and Alpha, are helping the coalition to learn more about Iraqi's anthrax program, according to Dr. David Kay, head of the Iraq survey group in charge of the hunt for WMD.", "He has said that the Iraqis made surprising innovations in the milling and drying processes needed to weaponize anthrax.", "The media coverage has been seriously confused on the issue of motive and the reason Senators Daschle and Leahy would have been targeted -- tending to simplistically view them as \"liberals.\"", "Zawahiri likely targeted Senators Daschle and Leahy to receive anthrax letters, in addition to various media outlets, because of the appropriations made pursuant to the \"Leahy Law\" to military and security forces.", "That money has prevented the militant islamists from achieving their goals.", "Al Qaeda members and sympathizers feel that the FBI's involvement in countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Indonesia, and the Philippines interferes with the sovereignty of those countries.", "According to a post she made on the internet, Aafia Siddiqui expressed the same sentiment in connection with US appropriations sought in exchange for the extradition of WTC 1993 plotter Ramzi Yousef from Pakistan.", "Senator Leahy was Chairman of both the Judiciary Committee overseeing the FBI and Appropriations Subcommittee in charge of foreign aid to these countries.", "In late September 2001, it was announced that the President was seeking a blanket waiver that would lift all restrictions on aid to military and security units in connection with pursuing the militant islamists.", "This extradition and imprisonment of Al Qaeda leaders, along with US support for Israel and the Mubarak government in Egypt, remains foremost in the mind of Dr. Zawahiri.", "At the height of the development of his biological weapons program, his brother was extradited pursuant to a death sentence in the \"Albanian returnees\" case (now he faces retrial).", "It's hard to keep up with the stories about billion dollar appropriations, debt forgiveness, and loan guarantees to countries like Egypt and Israel and now even Pakistan.", "Those appropriations pale in comparison to the many tens of billions in appropriations relating to the invasion of Iraq.", "Al Qaeda had a motive in mind.", "In his Fall 2001 book titled Knights under the Banner of the Prophet, Zawahiri argued that the secular press was telling \"lies\" about the militant islamists -- to include the suggestion that the militant islamists were somehow the creation of the United States in connection with expelling the Russians from Afghanistan.", "Zawahiri argued instead that they have been active since the assassination of Anwar Sadat in Egypt because of the Camp David Accord and the resulting peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.", "The anthrax letters were sent on the date of the Camp David Accord and then the date Anwar Sadat was assassinated as if to underscore the point to anyone paying attention.", "Most of the \"talking heads\" on television, however, knew only that Daschle and Leahy were liberal democrats and did not know anything of Al Qaeda beyond what they read in the US newspapers.", "The FBI's profile includes a US-based supporter of the militant islamists.", "Attorney General Ashcroft explained that an \"either-or\" approach is not useful.", "The media has tended to overlook the fact that when the FBI uses the word \"domestic\" the word includes a US-based, highly-educated supporter of the militant islamists.", "There is an emerging consensus that anthrax was contained in a letter to AMI, the publisher of the National Enquirer -- in a goofy love letter to Jennifer Lopez enclosing a Star of David and proposing marriage.", "A report by the Center for Disease Control of interviews with AMI employees (as well as detailed interviews by author Leonard Cole) supports the conclusion that there were not one, but two, such mailings containing anthrax.", "(The letters were to different AMI publications -- one to the National Enquirer and another to The Sun).", "(News assistant Bobby Bender recalls the letter containing the items to have been addressed to The Sun.)", "This tactic of letters is not merely the modus operandi of these militant islamists inspired by Zawahiri, it is their signature.", "The islamists sent letter bombs in January 1997 to newspaper offices in New York City and Washington, D.C..", "They were sent in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center and the imprisonment of the blind sheik, Sheik Abdel Rahman.", "The former leader of the Egyptian Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya (\"Islamic Group\"), he was also a spiritual leader of Al Qaeda.", "The letter bombs were sent in connection with the treatment of the Egyptian islamists imprisoned for the earlier attack on the WTC and a related plot.", "The purpose of the letter bombs -- which resulted in minimal casualty -- was to send a message.", "(There initially was an outstanding $2 million reward -- under the rewards for justice program, the reward now is up to $5 million.).", "There was no claim of responsibility.", "There was no explanation.", "Once one had been received, the next ten, mailed on two separate dates, were easily collected.", "Sound familiar?", "Two bombs were also sent to Leavenworth, where a key WTC 1993 defendant was imprisoned, addressed to \"Parole Officer.\"", "(The position does not exist).", "Abdel Rahman's son was captured in Quetta, Pakistan in mid-February 2003.", "That arrest in turn led to the dramatic capture of Khalid Mohammed, Al Qaeda's #3.", "Mohammed allegedly was hiding in the home of the Pakistani bacteriologist Dr. Abdul Qadoos Khan.", "Along with Zawahiri, Abdel Rahman and his two sons have had considerable influence over Bin Laden.", "He reportedly treated them like sons.", "Although while in jail in the early 1980s, Zawahiri caused considerable tension by challenging the blind sheik's ability to lead a coalition of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Egyptian Islamic Group, Zawahiri and OBL are Rahman's friends.", "The imprisoned WTC 1993 plotter Yousef was KSM's nephew.", "Thus, the leaders in charge of Al Qaeda's anthrax production program had a close connection to those imprisoned in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center.", "According to the controversial \"Feith memo,\" which summarized purported intelligence showing an Iraqi/Al Qaeda connection, Osama Bin Laden had asked Iraqi intelligence for technical assistance in sending letter bombs a half year before the Al Hayat letters were sent.", "Just because Al Qaeda likes its truck bombs and the like to be effective does not mean they do not see the value in a deadly missive.", "As Brian Jenkins once said, \"terrorism is theater.\"", "A sender purporting to be islamist sent cyanide in both early 2002 and early 2003 in New Zealand and ingredients of nerve gas in Belgium in 2003.", "There's even a chapter titled \"Poisonous Letter\" in the Al Qaeda manual.", "The \"Federal Eagle\" stamp used in the anthrax mailings was a blue-green.", "It was widely published among the militant islamists that martyrs go to paradise \"in the hearts of green birds.\"", "In the very interview in which they admitted 9/11, and described the codes used for the four targets for the planes, the masterminds admitted to the Jenny code, the code for representing the date 9/11, and used the symbolism of the \"Green Birds.\"", "Osama Bin Laden later invoked the symbolism in his video \"The 19 Martyrs.\"", "A FAQ on the Azzam Publications website explained that \"In the Hearts of Green Birds\" refers to what is inside.", "The mailer's use of \"Greendale School\" as the return address for the letters to the Senators is also revealing.", "A May 2001 letter that Zawahiri sent to Egyptian Islamic Jihad members abroad establish that Zawahiri used \"school\" as a code word for the Egyptian militant islamists in his correspondence.", "Green symbolizes Islam and was the Prophet Mohammed's color.", "By Greendale School, the anthrax perp was being cute, just as Yazid Sufaat was being cute in naming his lab Green Laboratory Medicine.", "\"Dale\" means \"river valley.\"", "Greendale likely refers to green river valley -- i.e., Cairo's Egyptian Islamic Jihad or the Islamic Group.", "The sender probably is announcing that he is of either Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Egyptian Islamic Group or Jihad-al Qaeda, which is actually the full name of the group after the merger of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda.", "At the Darunta complex where jihadis trained, recruits would wear green uniforms, except for Friday when they were washed.", "In a Hadith the Messenger of Allah explains that the souls of the martyrs are in the hearts of green birds that fly wherever they please in the Paradise.", "As to opportunity, though seldom reported, there is a wealth of \"open source\" information about possible Al Qaeda or Egyptian Islamic Jihad or Egyptian Islamic Group in the United States and Canada.", "The public information mostly relates to those suspected sleepers who have been detained or who are at large and are being sought.", "Zawahiri's mission in the United States in 1995 was to do spadework for terrorism, not fundraising for charitable causes.", "He traveled under an alias and was accompanied by a former US Army sergeant named Ali Mohammed.", "What mosques exactly did they visit and who did they meet?", "Whatever your political persuasion, the FBI and CIA deserve our support.", "We are, after all, in this together.", "First, the nature of such an investigation is that we lack sufficient information to second-guess (or even know) what the FBI is doing.", "Media reports are a poor approximation of reality because of the lack of good sources.", "Second, hindsight is 20/20.", "Third, with the \"new age\" Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. in charge of the investigation, it is not likely we could do better in striking the appropriate balance between due process and national security.", "Finally, the \"Hatfill theory\" seems to have been exhausted or at least lost public favor.", "The \"Hatfill theory\" accusing Dr. Stephen Hatfill was always highly dubious.", "The suspicion was founded on many false premises, and there was no reliable publicly known evidence indicating his guilt.", "The FBI's fixation on Hatfill (at least as rumored by some reporters) may have stemmed from a warning by one Senator that careers hung in the balance.", "Leahy's chief of staff apparently started with the strong predisposition that some right-winger was involved because two liberal democrats had been targeted.", "The Hatfill theory -- to include ongoing interviews and ongoing 7/24 surveillance by 8 surveillance specialists -- is now the subject of pending civil rights and libel claims of uncertain merit.", "A suit against the New York Times and columnist Nicholas Kristof was dismissed in late November 2004.", "The judge had agreed to delay the civil rights matter from proceeding until at least October 2004.", "The judge, frustrated by the apparent lack of progress, encouraged that the parties reach a negotiated compromise that would permit some limited discovery to proceed (and the judge has directed that the government to file an Answer to the Complaint).", "The Hatfill Theory ironically might best be understood as an Al Qaeda theory, with a coincidental Malaysian connection adding to the other circumstances.", "Given the regrettable leaks that he was under suspicion, it is only fair that the FBI leak with equal enthusiasm the fact that Dr. Hatfill has now been dropped as a suspect if and when that proves to be the case.", "A search of Dr. Ken Berry's residences likely will prove just about the last gasp of a biodefense insider theory.", "Senior officials have been quoted in the press as saying that the searches were for the purpose of excluding him as much as including him.", "Maureen,", "Andre is going to look over the list of curves needed for the global assets (August Board meeting) one more time before I

incentive for these customers to seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC-approved charges. *", "* Adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in gas commodity markets, and identifies the capital projects needed to meet these guidelines over the course of the GA II period (2003-2007). *", "* Provides a high degree of rate stability, with a 3.5% escalator to capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects.", "The guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or catastrophic events. *", "* Preserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths, although somewhat less than the current differential. *", "* Proposes a two-stage open season for firm transportation services beginning in 2003, with end users receiving a first option on available capacity. *", "* Maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments.", "PG&E

nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier.", "\"They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much,\" said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March.", "\"All hell broke loose.''", "Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed.", "The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators.", "\"If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III.", "Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials.", "He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to \"fix\" prices, which would violate federal trade laws.", "In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market.", "The generators got their way.", "The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan.", "What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier.", "Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints.", "They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted.", "What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis.", "Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap.", "Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government.", "Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed.", "In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made.", "He didn't mention anything about it.", "\"In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said.", "With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs.", "\"The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said.", "\"It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant.", "This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business.\"", "Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show.", "Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion.", "Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians.", "Prices, he said, did not spike as a result.", "Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity.", "Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials.", "\"We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said.", "\"In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation.", "We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund.\"", "Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap.", "Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted.", "\"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers.", "\"He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing.\"", "The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions.", "Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said.", "James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter.", "\"They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said.", "\"They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do.\"", "What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired.", "He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues.", "\"We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out,\" Dunn said.", "\"Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''", "We should resurrect Mike Smith's note and get him on the call in the attempt to avoid recreating the wheel on this one.", "I can dig it up if you'd like.", "Sue and Jeff --", "I am having a meeting with Vicki and Janet Dietrich on Thursday to discuss our view on the ability to extend our current contracts in CA (for customers already on DA).", "Can we discuss this today or soon thereafter.", "My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this (maybe?) and our #1 priority is to work to get the PG&E model adopted across the state.", "Any news on how SCE and SDG&E will move forward?", "Thanks.", "Sounds good.", "I suggest a \"blind draw\" on the teams, best ball not scramble on the golf, and as for the wager, no emails from the losing team for one week!", "Is there any question?", "I'll leave to Steve to structure the deal.", "As I recall, Montavano, Shapiro and I usually make up one team, but I'm willing to switch around a bit.", "Best,", "Jeff", "Are you playing golf?", "And if yes, what's the game and wager???", "Jim", "\"Neal S.

has nominated a long-time Federal Judge named Samuel Alito to become the next member of the United States Supreme Court, to fill a vacancy created by the retirement of another member of the Court.", "Under our Constitution, this nomination cannot take effect unless and until the United States Senate gives its Consent, as described in our Constitution, Article II, Section 2.", "A copy of the Constitution, with links back to the official source, is located at http://loveallpeople.org/usconstitutiona.txt", "Judge Samuel Alito is very highly qualified by all of the normal standards used to evaluate candidates for this position:", "He has a very high intellect.", "He graduated very high in his class, from Princeton undergraduate and from Law School at Yale.", "He has a long and distinguished record, including many years as a Federal Appeals Judge, the next level below Supreme Court.", "He has encyclopedic knowledge of hundreds of different Supreme Court cases, and he can recite details from memory.", "He demonstrates an excellent \"Judicial Temperament,\" being courteous, mild-mannered, respectful of all people; careful in his work, meticulous in detail.", "His co-workers love him.", "His fellow judges love him.", "His family loves him.", "President Bush loves him.", "Yes, it is true that some people don't like the way they think he will vote on the Supreme Court.", "But other people do like the way they think he will vote, and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him.", "So now the Senate is getting ready to vote soon, on whether to approve him or not; and at this moment (evening of Jan. 27, 2006) it looks like he has more than the fifty-one votes needed for approval.", "The President is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote, because he very much wants to have Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court, to be judging the cases Bush is interested in.", "So there is a lot of hurry-up pressure on the Senate to give its prompt vote of approval.", "There is an old saying that applies in this situation: \"Act in haste, repent at leisure.\"", "Sometimes you can make a bad decision very quickly, then regret it for many years to come.", "That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito, in my opinion, because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice: He does not really agree with the system of \"Checks and Balances\" built into the Constitution, and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the \"Unitary Executive Theory,\" which calls for vastly-increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court.", "And because of this tragic flaw . . .", "\"He

believes in a little-known Constitutional theory - called the \"Unitary Executive Theory\" - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch, and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does, including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control, and the Military, which exists, which is regulated, and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress, not to the President.", "The Military is not part of the Executive Branch: it is a separate entity.", "\"Commander In Chief\" doesn't mean that he is the boss of the Military, merely that he is the Administrator, just as he is the Administrator of the Executive Branch, charged with \"executing faithfully\" all the laws passed by Congress and all the Decisions rendered by the Supreme Court.", "Under the Unitary Executive Theory, the Laws of Congress and Decisions of the Supreme Court have no actual authority unless the President agrees with them.", "And so Congress and the Supreme Court become mere advisors to the President, with no real authority over him.", "And the President becomes a Dictator, unrestrained by anything in the Constitution, backed up by the Armed Forces, which would be entirely under his personal control.", "And thus the

since he ate up Red Riding Hood's grandma and blew down the houses of two-thirds of the Three Little Pigs, the Big Bad Wolf has held a persistently bad reputation.", "In part because of that reputation, the gray wolf was nearly exterminated from the lower 48 states by the 1920s, except for a small remnant population on Isle Royale National Park in Michigan's Lake Superior.", "The last wolf was killed in Yellowstone National Park in 1943.", "Western sheep and cattle ranchers, on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted, gratefully dusted their hands of the wolf and wrote him off as a job well done.", "Their sheep could graze, their cows could ruminate and never a discouraging word would be heard.", "After the major kill-offs, wolves outside of Alaska and Canada existed mostly as legend.", "Like UFOs or Sasquatch, several people claimed to see fleeting lone wolves, usually in Yellowstone.", "In the 1960s, a group shooting a movie in the Wyoming park reportedly imported some captive wolves, then released them when their shooting was done.", "If so, this happy band has not been heard from since.", "Rumor also had it some renegade biologist brought a caged pair to Yellowstone and released them into the wild sometime in the 1970s, hoping to reestablish a breeding population.", "If true, the caper failed.", "Over time, the wolf's absence seemed to rehabilitate its image.", "Eventually, a trickle of support appeared for bringing the predator back to its former home range in the northern Rocky Mountains.", "This trickle grew into a flood, resulting in 14 wolves being reintroduced in Yellowstone in 1995 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service -- albeit over the strong and still-continuing objections of ranchers.", "These wolf packs have flourished, and now there are an estimated 850 wolves roaming the northern Rockies, where merely 10 years ago there were none.", "One compelling argument for reintroduction was the wolf acts as a keystone predator, an animal that affects the populations, behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range.", "Some recent research conducted by Oregon State University has given considerable credence to this idea.", "OSU forestry professors William Ripple and Robert Beschta have found that wolves actually promote stream-bank stabilization, although they have given the phenomenon the unfortunate name of \"the ecology of fear\" -- something that smacks of the horrible PR resulting from the wolf's relationships with Riding Hood and the Three Pigs.", "They explained that elk in Yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams, a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion.", "Since reintroduction, however, Ripple and Beschta have found, fear of the wolves apparently has discouraged the elk from spending too much time at stream banks -- where they are out in the open -- and munching on the saplings.", "\"All you have to do is look at the photographs,\" Ed Bangs, wolf recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told UPI's

from the endangered species list altogether.", "Bangs said the agency has established viable wolf packs in the northern Rockies, as required by federal regulations.", "Some conservationists want the protection extended so wolves can move into other states, including Colorado, Utah and Oregon, among others.", "On Jan. 31, Oregon Federal District Court Judge Robert E. Jones appeared to agree with them.", "He vacated the FWS decision to downgrade the wolf's status.", "Bangs said his agency is still reviewing the decision.", "Regardless of the wolf's legal status, its future expansion into new areas now seems likely.", "Wolves can migrate considerable distances.", "A Yellowstone wolf was found dead, hit by a car, on a Colorado highway last year, several hundred miles from home.", "Meanwhile, his reputation seems to be improving, although Bangs noted a \"pretty interesting social dynamic.\"", "There are only about 850 wolves in the West, but there are an estimated 31,000 mountain lions.", "Pound for pound, mountain lions eat more game and more livestock than wolves.", "They even occasionally attack people, which wolves do not -- despite the propaganda from the Brothers Grimm.", "Yet people seem willing -- even eager -- to accommodate mountain lions, despite the risks.", "It remains to be seen whether they will extend the same courtesy to the arriving gray wolf.", "Regarding those rumors about wolves living in Yellowstone prior to the official reintroduction?", "They seem to be just that: rumors.", "True, there are about 300,000 wolves and wolf hybrids kept as pets in the United States.", "It also is likely people have released some of these animals into the wild hoping they would survive -- for instance, a ranger in Glacier Park caught someone in this very act not long ago.", "Bangs said these animals are not equipped to survive in the wild, however, and they all almost certainly have died.", "He said after 10 years of DNA testing

Climate last week.", "Pew researchers looked at about 40 studies that could provide an assessment of whether climate was affecting biology.", "\"Half of the studies provide strong evidence of a causal link between the biological change and climate change,\" said Camille Parmesan, a University of Texas-Austin biologist and one of the world's leading experts on this issue.", "These changes are occurring across all species, Parmesan told UPI's Climate.", "\"Across the United States, the northern edge of species' range is expanding,\" she said.", "Parmesan has spent much of her career

pointed to climate as being a strong driver,\" she said.", "\"There have been large numbers of population extinctions in Mexico and southern California in areas where the habitat is still acceptable.\"", "According to Parmesan's earlier studies, one extinction event, for instance, was triggered when a checkerspot population migrated north prematurely, relying on a warming temperature signal, then was caught in a severe snowstorm in its northern habitat.", "Throughout the United States, she said, \"spring is about two weeks earlier.", "Tree swallows are nesting nine days earlier.", "Tropical species have moved up to Florida and the Gulf Coast.", "Bird and butterfly watchers are seeing many, many new species coming up from Mexico and the Caribbean.\"", "As the Pew report concluded, \"Sufficient studies now exist to conclude that the consequences of climate change are already detectable within U.S. ecosystems.\"", "Such consequences include shifting and, in some cases, contraction of ranges and changes in species composition within ecosystems.", "The report also found alterations of ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling and storage.", "The Alaskan tundra, for instance, has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide -- absorbing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases -- to \"being a net source of CO2 (releasing more carbon than is stored) because warmer winters have allowed dead plant matter previously stored in the soil to decompose and release CO2.\"", "The Pew report coincided with the release in Iceland of the \"Arctic Climate Impact Assessment.\"", "The ACIA -- with participation by the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation and Sweden -- was begun in 2000.", "\"The impacts

models predicting complete disappearance of summer sea ice.", "\"Should the Arctic Ocean become ice-free in summer, it is likely that polar bears and some seal species would be driven toward extinction,\" the report concluded.", "As with so much climate research, not everyone agrees with these dire predictions.", "A third report, \"The Impacts of Climate Change: An Appraisal for the Future,\" completed by the Britain-based International Policy Network and released almost simultaneously with the other two, falls somewhat into that category.", "On the one hand, the IPN report agreed \"Climate models generally predict that the temperature rises in the Arctic will substantially exceed the global rise.", "This applies especially in the high Arctic where the ice cover is expected to diminish substantially with the effect that the surface absorption of solar radiation will greatly increase.\"", "On the other hand, the report thinks the news might not be so bad for the North Atlantic fisheries.", "\"The impact of global warming on fish stocks and fisheries is hard to judge,\" the IPN report said.", "\"A warming of the magnitude predicted is more likely than not to

thing.", "The problem is whether one cares what happens to the polar bears, checkerspot butterflies and other unconsumables.", "The Pew researchers tried to transcend the economic argument.", "They

pilot", "he is said by one fbi agent to be very very very dangerous", "he allegedly was at one or more meetings in the summer of 2001 in pakistan at which ksm and sufaat were present", "he may have been seen in hamilton canada along with egyptian al maati who apparently also has received pilot training", "the united states truly no longer has time for faulty analysis or politically based preconceptions", "in early june 2003 a cia report concluded that the reason for atta's atta 's and zacarias moussaoui's moussaoui 's inquiries into cropdusters was in fact for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax", "it has long been known osama bin laden was interested in using cropdusters to disperse biological agents since the testimony of millennium bomber ahmed ressam", "the hijacker ahmed alhaznawi appears to have contracted cutaneous anthrax in afghanistan", "it is reasonable to credit his statement that he got the lesion after bumping into a suitcase he was carrying at a camp in afghanistan", "the lesion is further evidence of al qaeda's qaeda 's anthrax production program at kandahar", "the present evidence relating to atta's atta 's alleged travel to prague does not warrant a conclusion that al qaeda obtained the ames strain from iraq", "iraq however remains a possible source of the ames", "former russian bioweaponeer ken alibek has said that a key russian scientist assisted iraq and that russia had the ames strain", "his conclusion may have been based on the fake mobile biolab plans foisted upon the us by the chalabi associate curveball which alibek divined to be identical to russian mobile lab design", "zawahiri did travel to baghdad in 1998 with an entourage to attend the birthday party of saddam's saddam 's son", "the papers found at headquarters of the mukhabarat iraq's iraq 's secret police show that an entourage from al qaeda group was sent to the iraqi capital in march 1998 from sudan", "according to at least some reports bin laden rejected the suggestion of a closer alliance preferring to pursue his own concept of jihad", "two top iraqi scientists code named charlie and alpha are helping the coalition to learn more about iraqi's iraqi 's anthrax program according to dr. david kay head of the iraq survey group in charge of the hunt for wmd", "he has said that the iraqis made surprising innovations in the milling and drying processes needed to weaponize anthrax", "the media coverage has been seriously confused on the issue of motive and the reason senators daschle and leahy would have been targeted tending to simplistically view them as liberals", "zawahiri likely targeted senators daschle and leahy to receive anthrax letters in addition to various media outlets because of the appropriations made pursuant to the leahy law to military and security forces", "that money has prevented the militant islamists from achieving their goals", "al qaeda members and sympathizers feel that the fbi's fbi 's involvement in countries like egypt saudi arabia pakistan indonesia and the philippines interferes with the sovereignty of those countries", "according to a post she made on the internet aafia siddiqui expressed the same sentiment in connection with us appropriations sought in exchange for the extradition of wtc 1993 plotter ramzi yousef from pakistan", "senator leahy was chairman of both the judiciary committee overseeing the fbi and appropriations subcommittee in charge of foreign aid to these countries", "in late september 2001 it was announced that the president was seeking a blanket waiver that would lift all restrictions on aid to military and security units in connection with pursuing the militant islamists", "this extradition and imprisonment of al qaeda leaders along with us support for israel and the mubarak government in egypt remains foremost in the mind of dr. zawahiri", "at the height of the development of his biological weapons program his brother was extradited pursuant to a death sentence in the albanian returnees case now he faces retrial", "it's it 's hard to keep up with the stories about billion dollar appropriations debt forgiveness and loan guarantees to countries like egypt and israel and now even pakistan", "those appropriations pale in comparison to the many tens of billions in appropriations relating to the invasion of iraq", "al qaeda had a motive in mind", "in his fall 2001 book titled knights under the banner of the prophet zawahiri argued that the secular press was telling lies about the militant islamists to include the suggestion that the militant islamists were somehow the creation of the united states in connection with expelling the russians from afghanistan", "zawahiri argued instead that they have been active since the assassination of anwar sadat in egypt because of the camp david accord and the resulting peace treaty between egypt and israel", "the anthrax letters were sent on the date of the camp david accord and then the date anwar sadat was assassinated as if to underscore the point to anyone paying attention", "most of the talking heads on television however knew only that daschle and leahy were liberal democrats and did not know anything of al qaeda beyond what they read in the us newspapers", "the fbi's fbi 's profile includes a us based supporter of the militant islamists", "attorney general ashcroft explained that an either or approach is not useful", "the media has tended to overlook the fact that when the fbi uses the word domestic the word includes a us based highly educated supporter of the militant islamists", "there is an emerging consensus that anthrax was contained in a letter to ami the publisher of the national enquirer in a goofy love letter to jennifer lopez enclosing a star of david and proposing marriage", "a report by the center for disease control of interviews with ami employees as well as detailed interviews by author leonard cole supports the conclusion that there were not one but two such mailings containing anthrax", "the letters were to different ami publications one to the national enquirer and another to the sun", "news assistant bobby bender recalls the letter containing the items to have been addressed to the sun", "this tactic of letters is not merely the modus operandi of these militant islamists inspired by zawahiri it is their signature", "the islamists sent letter bombs in january 1997 to newspaper offices in new york city and washington d.c.", "they were sent in connection with the earlier bombing of the world trade center and the imprisonment of the blind sheik sheik abdel rahman", "the former leader of the egyptian al gamaa al islamiya islamic group he was also a spiritual leader of al qaeda", "the letter bombs were sent in connection with the treatment of the egyptian islamists imprisoned for the earlier attack on the wtc and a related plot", "the purpose of the letter bombs which resulted in minimal casualty was to send a message", "there initially was an outstanding 2 million reward under the rewards for justice program the reward now is up to 5 million", "there was no claim of responsibility", "there was no explanation", "once one had been received the next ten mailed on two separate dates were easily collected", "sound familiar", "two bombs were also sent to leavenworth where a key wtc 1993 defendant was imprisoned addressed to parole officer", "the position does not exist", "abdel rahman's rahman 's son was captured in quetta pakistan in mid-february 2003", "that arrest in turn led to the dramatic capture of khalid mohammed al qaeda's qaeda 's 3", "mohammed allegedly was hiding in the home of the pakistani bacteriologist dr. abdul qadoos khan", "along with zawahiri abdel rahman and his two sons have had considerable influence over bin laden", "he reportedly treated them like sons", "although while in jail in the early 1980s zawahiri caused considerable tension by challenging the blind sheik's sheik 's ability to lead a coalition of the egyptian islamic jihad and the egyptian islamic group zawahiri and obl are rahman's rahman 's friends", "the imprisoned wtc 1993 plotter yousef was ksm's ksm 's nephew", "thus the leaders in charge of al qaeda's qaeda 's anthrax production program had a close connection to those imprisoned in connection with the earlier bombing of the world trade center", "according to the controversial feith memo which summarized purported intelligence showing an iraqi al qaeda connection osama bin laden had asked iraqi intelligence for technical assistance in sending letter bombs a half year before the al hayat letters were sent", "just because al qaeda likes its truck bombs and the like to be effective does not mean they do not see the value in a deadly missive", "as brian jenkins once said terrorism is theater", "a sender purporting to be islamist sent cyanide in both early 2002 and early 2003 in new zealand and ingredients of nerve gas in belgium in 2003", "there's there 's even a chapter titled poisonous letter in the al qaeda manual", "the federal eagle stamp used in the anthrax mailings was a blue green", "it was widely published among the militant islamists that martyrs go to paradise in the hearts of green birds", "in the very interview in which they admitted 9/11 and described the codes used for the four targets for the planes the masterminds admitted to the jenny code the code for representing the date 9/11 and used the symbolism of the green birds", "osama bin laden later invoked the symbolism in his video the 19 martyrs", "a faq on the azzam publications website explained that in the hearts of green birds refers to what is inside", "the mailer's mailer 's use of greendale school as the return address for the letters to the senators is also revealing", "a may 2001 letter that zawahiri sent to egyptian islamic jihad members abroad establish that zawahiri used school as a code word for the egyptian militant islamists in his correspondence", "green symbolizes islam and was the prophet mohammed's mohammed 's color", "by greendale school the anthrax perp was being cute just as yazid sufaat was being cute in naming his lab green laboratory medicine", "dale means river valley", "greendale likely refers to green river valley i.e. cairo's cairo 's egyptian islamic jihad or the islamic group", "the sender probably is announcing that he is of either egyptian islamic jihad egyptian islamic group or jihad al qaeda which is actually the full name of the group after the merger of the egyptian islamic jihad and al qaeda", "at the darunta complex where jihadis trained recruits would wear green uniforms except for friday when they were washed", "in a hadith the messenger of allah explains that the souls of the martyrs are in the hearts of green birds that fly wherever they please in the paradise", "as to opportunity though seldom reported there is a wealth of open source information about possible al qaeda or egyptian islamic jihad or egyptian islamic group in the united states and canada", "the public information mostly relates to those suspected sleepers who have been detained or who are at large and are being sought", "zawahiri's zawahiri 's mission in the united states in 1995 was to do spadework for terrorism not fundraising for charitable causes", "he traveled under an alias and was accompanied by a former us army sergeant named ali mohammed", "what mosques exactly did they visit and who did they meet", "whatever your political persuasion the fbi and cia deserve our support", "we are after all in this together", "first the nature of such an investigation is that we lack sufficient information to second guess or even know what the fbi is doing", "media reports are a poor approximation of reality because of the lack of good sources", "second hindsight is 20 20", "third with the new age efrem zimbalist jr. in charge of the investigation it is not likely we could do better in striking the appropriate balance between due process and national security", "finally the hatfill theory seems to have been exhausted or at least lost public favor", "the hatfill theory accusing dr. stephen hatfill was always highly dubious", "the suspicion was founded on many false premises and there was no reliable publicly known evidence indicating his guilt", "the fbi's fbi 's fixation on hatfill at least as rumored by some reporters may have stemmed from a warning by one senator that careers hung in the balance", "leahy's leahy 's chief of staff apparently started with the strong predisposition that some right winger was involved because two liberal democrats had been targeted", "the hatfill theory to include ongoing interviews and ongoing 7 24 surveillance by 8 surveillance specialists is now the subject of pending civil rights and libel claims of uncertain merit", "a suit against the new york times and columnist nicholas kristof was dismissed in late november 2004", "the judge had agreed to delay the civil rights matter from proceeding until at least october 2004", "the judge frustrated by the apparent lack of progress encouraged that the parties reach a negotiated compromise that would permit some limited discovery to proceed and the judge has directed that the government to file an answer to the complaint", "the hatfill theory ironically might best be understood as an al qaeda theory with a coincidental malaysian connection adding to the other circumstances", "given the regrettable leaks that he was under suspicion it is only fair that the fbi leak with equal enthusiasm the fact that dr. hatfill has now been dropped as a suspect if and when that proves to be the case", "a search of dr. ken berry's berry 's residences likely will prove just about the last gasp of a biodefense insider theory", "senior officials have been quoted in the press as saying that the searches were for the purpose of excluding him as much as including him", "maureen", "andre is going to look over the list of curves needed for the global assets august board meeting one more time before i forward it to you", "he will make sure that we do

acted in concert to manipulate energy prices", "the investigative committee headed by state sen. joe dunn d santa ana is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the capitol the palace coup", "lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events directed by the man who heads the state's state 's energy grid fueled the california energy crisis pushed the state into the power buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers", "the central question behind the palace coup is whether terry winter the president of the independent system operator acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge", "winter defied his own board and gov. gray davis when he filed a 50 page request to remove the caps records and interviews show", "i don't do n't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort said dunn", "the subpoenas will force those involved including winter to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee and to turn over e-mails personal calendars and memos", "davis spokesman steve maviglio said the governor felt betrayed by the actions of winter", "the governor believes it was the defining moment when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis maviglio said", "winter refused comment referring all questions to the public relations office", "iso spokesman gregg fishman said dunn's dunn 's committee will find no criminal conduct", "the decision was made by iso upper management with one goal in mind to keep the lights on", "at the time generators were refusing to sell power in california because of the price caps", "it was an emergency fishman said", "we had to take action", "what became known as the palace coup began on oct. 26 when iso board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power", "the restrictions would drive prices as low as 65 per megawatt nearly 12 times below the 750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier", "they electricity generators grinned and beared the 750 price cap but this new plan by iso was too much said dunn whose committee has been investigating since march", "all hell broke loose", "records show that on oct. 31 power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the federal energy regulatory commission demanding that the new plan be killed", "the letters six in all were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators", "if not removed immediately the iso price cap will sow confusion in the market threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity read one letter written by duke energy vice president william hall iii", "although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials", "he said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to fix prices which would violate federal trade laws", "in the oct. 31 letters electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't were n't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market", "the generators got their way", "the next day the federal commission killed the new pricing plan", "what was left in place was a 250 price cap established five months earlier", "power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap saying they couldn't could n't make a profit even under these constraints", "they began to withhold power from california and on dec. 7 the iso declared its first stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts which were narrowly averted", "what followed the next day is considered by the governor and dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis", "winter who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the iso submitted a 50 page emergency request asking federal officials to abolish the 250 price cap", "final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government", "neither the iso board which had established the price cap nor the governor learned of winter's winter 's actions until the cap had been removed", "in fact the attorney who helped draft the emergency request charles robinson was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and iso board members just hours before the filing was made", "he didn't did n't mention anything about it", "in retrospect we should have told them robinson said", "with the price caps gone the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs", "the iso staff sat in a meeting with the governor's governor 's key energy advisers with poker faces not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment maviglio said", "it was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant", "this action accelerated the utilities' utilities ' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power buying business", "prices for electricity jumped from an average of 249 a megawatt to 700 a megawatt within three days iso records show", "dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded 30 billion", "robinson said the filing granted two hours after the request helped rather than hurt californians", "prices he said did not spike as a result", "instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas which is used to run power plants to generate electricity", "robinson said the emergency order allowed the iso to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials", "we believe the action we took addressed a severe concern robinson said", "in our view we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation", "we felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund", "jan smutney jones who was the iso board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators said winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap", "smutney jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power generating community being consulted", "terry did this by himself said smutney jones executive director of the independent energy producers", "he did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing", "the iso board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding winter explain his actions", "some board members pushed to have winter removed but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos the governor's governor 's spokesman maviglio said", "james j. hoecker the former federal energy regulatory commission chairman defended making the december decision and also defended winter", "they filed an emergency motion and we were not about to let california go dark hoecker said", "they iso management did what any independent system operator would do", "what dunn's dunn 's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired", "he believes memos and e-mails around the time of winter's winter 's dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues", "we don't do n't know why he did what he did

"these wolf packs have flourished and now there are an estimated 850 wolves roaming the northern rockies where merely 10 years ago there were none", "one compelling argument for reintroduction was the wolf acts as a keystone predator an animal that affects the populations behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range", "some recent research conducted by oregon state university

that elk in yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion", "since reintroduction however ripple and beschta have found fear of the wolves apparently has discouraged the elk from spending too much time at stream banks where they

shifting and in some cases contraction of ranges and changes in species composition within ecosystems", "the report also found alterations of ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling and storage", "the alaskan tundra for instance has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide absorbing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases to being a net source of co2 releasing more

factions loyal to iran", "the result will be a dramatic escalation in us and civilian casualties us forces will be required to bunker themselves further into their bases and us forces will find themselves required to fight the very government they just finished helping into power", "iraq already a seething cauldron will sink further into chaos", "2 iran's iran 's armaments", "unlike iraq iran has not spent the last fifteen years having its conventional forces worn down by grueling sanctions repeated attacks and two american led wars", "while iran's iran 's conventional army is not what it was during the heyday of the iran iraq war their armaments have deteriorated and the veterans of that last war have retired the nation enjoys substantial military strength nonetheless", "according to a report issued by the center for strategic and international studies in december of 2004 iran has some 540,000 men under arms and over 350,000 reserves", "they include 120,000 iranian revolutionary guards trained for land and naval asymmetrical warfare", "iran's iran 's military also includes holdings of 1,613 main battle tanks 21,600 other armored fighting vehicles 3,200 artillery weapons 306 combat aircraft 60 attack helicopters 3 submarines 59 surface combatants and 10 amphibious ships", "iran is now the only regional military power that poses a significant conventional military threat to gulf stability continued the csis report", "iran has significant capabilities for asymmetric warfare and poses the additional threat of proliferation", "there is considerable evidence that it is developing both a long range missile force and a range of weapons of mass destruction", "it has never properly declared its holdings of chemical weapons and the status of its biological weapons programs is unknown", "a milnet brief issued in february 2005 reports due to its position astride the persian gulf iran has constantly been a threat to the gulf", "the so called tanker wars in the late 1980s put iran squarely in the bullseye of all nations seeking to transport oil out of the region", "even the small navy that iran puts to sea is capable enough to harass shipping and several cases of small boat operations against oil well heads in the gulf during that period made it clear small asymmetrical tactics of the iranian navy could be quite effective", "more concerning continued the milnet brief is the priority placed on expanding and modernizing its navy", "the csis report cites numerous areas where iran has funded modernization including the most troublesome aspect anti-shipping cruise missiles iran has obtained new anti-ship missiles and missile patrol craft from china midget submarines from north korea submarines from russia and modern mines", "it is iran's iran 's missile armaments that pose the greatest concern for american forces in the gulf especially for the us navy", "iran's iran 's coast facing the persian gulf is a looming wall of mountains that look down upon any naval forces arrayed in those waters", "the gulf itself only has one exit the strait of hormuz which is also dominated by the mountainous iranian coastline", "in essence iran holds the high ground in the gulf", "missile batteries arrayed in those mountains could raise bloody havoc with any fleet deployed below", "of all the missiles in iran's iran 's armament the most dangerous is the russian made ss-n-22 sunburn", "these missiles are simply the fastest anti-ship weapons on the planet", "the sunburn can reach mach 3 at high altitude", "its maximum low altitude speed is mach 2.2 some three times faster than the american made harpoon", "the sunburn takes two short minutes to cover its full range", "the missile's missile 's manufacturers state that one or two missiles could cripple a destroyer and five missiles could sink a 20,000 ton ship", "the sunburn is also superior to the exocet missile", "recall that it was two exocets that ripped the uss stark to shreds in 1987 killing 37 sailors", "the stark could not see them to stop them", "the us aircraft carrier theodore roosevelt is currently deployed in the persian gulf with some 7,000 souls aboard", "sailing with the roosevelt is the tarawa expeditionary strike force which includes the uss tarawa the uss austin and the uss pearl harbor", "the uss austin is likewise deployed in the gulf", "the sunburn missile with its incredible speed and ability to avoid radar detection would do terrible damage _ these ships if iran chooses to retaliate in the gulf after an american attack within its borders", "beyond the naval threat is the possibility of iran throwing its military muscle into the ongoing struggle in iraq", "currently the us is facing an asymmetrical attack from groups wielding small arms shoulder fired grenades and roadside bombs", "the vaunted american military has suffered 2,210 deaths and tens of thousands of wounded from this form of warfare", "the occupation of iraq has become a guerrilla war a siege that has lasted more than a thousand days", "if iran decides to throw any or all of its 23,000 armored fighting vehicles along with any or all of its nearly million strong army into the iraq fray the situation in the middle east could become unspeakably dire", "3 the syrian connection", "in february of 2005 iran and syria agreed upon a mutual protection pact to combat challenges and threats in the region", "this was a specific reaction to the american invasion of iraq and a reaction to america's america 's condemnation of syria after the death of lebanese prime minister rafik hariri which was widely seen as an assassination ordered from damascus", "an attack on iran would trigger this mutual defense pact and could conceivably bring syria into direct conflict with american forces", "like iran syria's syria 's military is nothing to scoff at", "virtually every credible analysis has syria standing as the strongest military force in the middle east after israel", "damascus has been intent for years upon establishing significant military strength to serve as a counterweight to israel's israel 's overwhelming capabilities", "as of 2002 syria had some 215,000 soldiers under arms 4,700 tanks and a massive artillery capability", "the syrian air force is comprised of ten to eleven fighter attack squadrons and sixteen fighter squadrons totaling somewhere near 650 aircraft", "syria also possesses one of the largest arsenals of ballistic missiles in the region comprised primarily of scud derived systems", "iran north korea and china have been willing providers of state of the art technologies", "compounding this is the well based suspicion that syria has perhaps the most advanced chemical weapons capability in the persian gulf", "4 china and the us economy", "while the ominous possibilities of heightened iraqi chaos missiles in the gulf and syrian involvement loom large if the us attacks iran all pale in comparison to the involvement of china in any us iran engagement", "china's china 's economy is exploding hampered only by their great thirst for petroleum and natural gas to fuel their industry", "in the last several months china has inked deals with iran for 70 billion dollars worth of iranian oil and natural gas", "china will purchase 250 million tons of liquefied natural gas from iran over the next 30 years will develop the massive yadavaran oil field in iran and will receive 150,000 barrels of oil per day from that field", "china is seeking the construction of a pipeline from iran to the caspian sea where it would link with another planned pipeline running from kazakhstan to china", "any us attack on iran could be perceived by china as a direct threat to its economic health", "further any fighting in the persian gulf would imperil the tankers running china's china 's liquefied natural gas through the strait of hormuz", "should china decide to retaliate against the us to defend its oil and natural gas deal with iran the us would be faced with a significant threat", "this threat exists not merely on a military level though china could force a confrontation in the pacific by way of taiwan", "more significantly china holds a large portion of the american economy in the palm of its hand", "paul craig roberts writing for the american conservative said in july of 2005 that as a result of many years of persistent trade surpluses with the united states the japanese government holds dollar reserves of approximately 1 trillion", "china's china 's accumulation of dollars is approximately 600 billion", "south korea holds about 200 billion", "these sums give these countries enormous leverage over the united states", "by dumping some portion of their reserves these countries could put the dollar under intense pressure and send u.s. interest rates skyrocketing", "washington would really have to anger japan and korea to provoke such action but in a showdown with china over taiwan for example china holds the cards", "china and japan and the world at large have more dollar reserves than they require", "they would have no problem teaching a hegemonic superpower a lesson if the need arose", "the hardest blow on americans concluded roberts will fall when china does revalue its currency", "when china's china 's currency ceases to be undervalued american shoppers in wal mart where 70 percent of the goods on the shelves are made in china will think they are in neiman marcus", "price increases will cause a dramatic reduction in american real incomes", "if this coincides with rising interest rates and a setback in the housing market american consumers will experience the hardest times since the great depression", "in short china has the american economy by the throat", "should they decide to squeeze we will all feel it", "china's china 's strong hand in this even extends to the diplomatic realm china is a permanent member of the united nations security council and could veto any actions against iran proposed by the united states", "5 american preparedness", "american citizens have for decades taken it as a given that our military can overwhelm and overcome any foe on the battlefield", "the rapid victory during the first gulf war cemented this perception", "the last three years of the iraq occupation however have sapped this confidence", "worse the occupation has done great damage to the strength of the american military justifying the decrease in confidence", "thanks to repeated deployments to iraq and afghanistan recruiting is at an all time low", "soldiers with vital training and know how are refusing to re-enlist", "across the board the american military is stretched to the breaking point", "two vaunted economists one a nobel prize winner and the other a nationally renowned budget expert have analyzed the data at hand and put a price tag on the iraq occupation", "according to linda bilmes of harvard and nobel laureate joseph e. stiglitz of columbia university the final cost of the iraq occupation will run between 1 trillion and 2 trillion surpassing by orders of magnitude the estimates put forth by the bush administration", "if an engagement with iran envelops our forces in iraq and comes to involve syria our economy will likely shatter under the strain of fighting so many countries simultaneously", "add to this the economic threat posed by china and the economic threat implicit in any substantial disruption of the distribution of mideast petroleum to the globe", "if iran and syria with their significant armaments missile technologies and suspected chemical weapons capabilities decide to engage with the relatively undersized us force in iraq our troops there will be fish in a barrel", "iran's iran 's position over the gulf would make resupply by ship and air support from carriers a dangerous affair", "in the worst case scenario the newly minted american order of battle requiring the use of nuclear weapons to rescue a surrounded and imperiled force could come into play hurling the entire planet into military and diplomatic bedlam", "conclusion is any of this possible", "the question must be put as directly as possible what manner of maniac would undertake a path so fraught with peril and potential economic catastrophe", "it is difficult to imagine a justification for any action that could envelop the united states in a military and economic conflict with iraq iran syria and china simultaneously", "iran is suspected by many nations of working towards the development of nuclear weapons but even this justification has been tossed into a cocked hat", "recently russian president vladimir putin bluntly stated that iran is not developing its nuclear capability for any reasons beyond peaceful energy creation and pledged to continue assisting iran in this endeavor", "therefore any attack upon iran's iran 's nuclear facilities will bring russia into the mess", "iran also stands accused of aiding terrorism across the globe", "the dangers implicit in any attack upon that nation however seem to significantly offset whatever gains could be made in the so called war on terror", "unfortunately all the dangers in the world are no match for the self assurance of a bubble encased zealot", "what manner of maniac would undertake such a dangerous course", "look no further than 1600 pennsylvania avenue", "george w. bush and his administration have consistently undertaken incredibly dangerous courses of action in order to garner political power on the home front", "recall the multiple terror threats lobbed out by the administration whenever damaging political news appeared in the media", "more significantly recall iraq", "karl rove bush's bush 's most senior advisor notoriously told republicans on the ballot during the 2002 midterms to run on the war", "the invasion of iraq provided marvelous political cover for the gop not only during those midterms but during the 2004 presidential election", "what kind of political cover would be gained from an attack on iran and from the diversion of attention to that attack", "the answer lies in one now familiar name jack abramoff", "the abramoff scandal threatens to subsume all the hard fought gop gains in congress and the 2006 midterms are less than a year away", "is any of this a probability", "logic says no but logic seldom plays any part in modern american politics", "all arguments that the bush administration would be insane to attack iran and risk a global

solved", "your male is hurting her to put her in her place biting her scruff is dominance and biting the belly is a move cats use when hunting to pull the guts out of their prey", "this is not good",

a huge army and would eventually launch an attack but he ignored his military advisers", "the communists agreed", "they could not defeat the americans", "however what they hoped to do during the tet offensive was to sneak past the americans and attack the arvn in the urban areas where they were deployed doing successful clear and defend operations", "the communists thought they could defeat the

happened", "the americans detected the attempt to infiltrate the urban areas and were already redeploying troops from the rural areas", "the arvn rushed back from holiday leave and counterattacked",

people rejected their attempt to topple the government and for all intents and purposes the us military and the arvn handed johnson the victory he had ordered them to achieve within the time frame he ordered it", "all he had to do for a complete victory was allow the military to go into laos and cambodia and finish off the shattered communist forces", "but johnson was so obtuse he didn\u2019t did

heat bulbs that's that 's the easy one to provide for", "uvb on the other hand can only be reproduced by a fluorescent source", "uvb will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp unless you use a mvb mercury vapor bulb which is the only reptile use bulb that will emit both uvb and heat from one bulb", "i highly recommend that you do not use coiled compact uvb bulbs as they are known to cause severe eye damage and or blindness in reptiles not to mention they have trouble maintaining uvb output over time", "the long tube uvb bulbs are best like zoomed's zoomed 's repsitun model remember to replace uvb bulbs according to the manufacturers manufacturer s recommendation after which time the bulb will no longer produce uvb even if visible light still is", "so to answer your question no if you just have a bulb that says it produces uva then you do not have the sun's sun 's rays that your bearded needs", "you need to also provide a source a uvb lighting", "the person at petsmart is very wrong in fact it is always a good idea to second guess what most pet store employees tell you they don't do n't have the best track record regarding giving reliable pet care info", "uvb and basking

treat items for variety's variety 's sake", "i would highly recommend that you read through some reliable bearded guides to make sure you have everything set up correctly", "", "", "mm it depends on the size of his tank or cage or whatever you have him in at least as far as i'm i 'm concerned", "if there are shady areas he can move to for example a 3 5 4 tank with light on one side then you can leave it on a full 12 14 hours if its it s a small tank and he can't ca n't escape the light then 4 6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4 6 hours at a time twice a day", "either way you also need to keep an eye on the temperature if you are using a dry fish tank as uv lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become an oven", "as to what the light provides it gives uv rays which is important for health in lizards as it is in humans", "that lady at petsmart is a disgrace to the rest of us petsmart associates sheesh", "yes it gives him the sun rays necessary that's that 's what uva is", "and it should be on 10 12 hours just like the sun would be up for 10 12 hours in his natural environment", "as for the heat just be sure to use a thermometer", "also beardies often do not eat food that is not moving so its it s anyone's anyone 's guess whether or not he'll he 'll touch the freeze dried crickets or the processed food", "i tell

am more available in case we were to hang out after", "anyway so that was 2 days ago that i called and left a message but he still hasn't has n't called back yet", "i don't do n't know if i should call him again tomorrow or not", "i know a lot of people say to wait until he calls you but it's it 's different because i'm i 'm a client and technically that's that 's all i am at this point", "on the other hand though if i'm i 'm a client he should really of called back by now because you don't do n't leave a customer hanging", "he didn't did n't have my number either because this was the first time i've i 've called him instead of his dad", "it's it 's a father and son business", "anyway i would appreciate any insight on this at all", "thank you for reading if you did", "ok well as far as him being a bad farrier for leaving a nail out that is not the case they are extremely well known farriers in the area", "i would be a lot more concerned if the shoe fell off because it was missing one lousy nail", "the reason he said he didn't did n't put that nail in was because he didn't did n't want to risk it with my horse's horse 's horrible feet", "this is about the fourth time they've they 've done my horse's horse 's feet because i just switched back to them", "the only reason i switched away from them in the first place is because my good friend who apprenticed with them was starting out on his own", "however he left my horse without a shoe for two weeks now that's that 's what i call a crap farrier", "which i might add is the same foot that keeps crumbling with the nails", "so obviously i switched back to these guys", "ok calm down it's it 's not like he's he 's some stranger that came up and groped me lol", "i've i 've known the guy for about 10 years", "i am 21 so yeah we were both kids when we knew each other", "he is a few years older than me", "and yes i do like him", "to answer barry white yes that did occur to me i hope that is all he's he 's waiting for", "on the other hand he could very easily just call me and say hey i'm i 'm busy right now i'll i 'll call you when i can come out", "and as far as scheduled visits go i have no idea", "i've i 've never done that before though either", "it's it 's always just okay they're feet need to be done better call the farrier", "and they usually come out within a few days", "he will call you back im i m sure", "sounds like he really likes you", "but you need to ask yourself do you feel the same way", "would you like going for coffee with him", "or is he not your type", "or are you undecided", "if i were you i would go", "i would say if he does not call you back by friday call him again he could be playing hard to get", "i think he left the nail out of the shoe as a excuse to come back and see you hey he may be your prince charming", "edit i really dont do nt think your horse is in danger of being hurt with one nail missing", "i have seen horses loose nails on there own and do just fine with one nail gone now if he had left out 2 or 3 i would be wondering to", "i really do belive he left the nail out becuse of the horses horse s hoof condition and its it s a added bonus he would get to see her again", "when i was younger in my early 20s my farrier was a hottie named joby for those who don't do n't know i am a girl read my bio on my page dumb as a post about everything but horses", "he was in his 30s divorced and had 2 kids but we both flirted horribly with each other but neither one of us took the chance and asked to other on a date", "sorta sort a wonder what it would have been like", "but that was years ago", "he had this habit of telling you everything", "well one day he said to me you know i don't do n't wear underwear as he was bent over working on my mares mare s right front hoof and i was like ummmm okay", "im i m glad his butt was facing me so he couldn't could n't see my red face i think my mare was even laughing", "well 6 weeks later when he came back out he was again working on my mares mare s front foot and i looked down and yeah he had wholes in his pants in the wrong places i bust out laughing and he was like what", "i was like ummmm i can see your ass cheeks he was like oops did i forget my underwear", "that was a strange way to flirt but i guss it was his way", "but like i said nothing ever came of it the next time i saw him he had told me he had to get married to a girl who he worked with becuse he knocked her up", "i was heartbroken but then realized he was not the guy for me", "wow he does sound interested in you my farrier never gives me hugs like that probably a good thing as he has a wife and 2 kids anyway i find that they can be very busy so i would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give him a call but don\u2019t do n\u2019t leave a message so you don\u2019t do n\u2019t have to necessarily wait for him to call", "from the point of view of a business and client operator relationships he's he 's doing a really shitty job", "leaving nails out so you'll you 'll call and have him come back out later", "cute or not i'd i 'd call a different bloke because he's he 's doing a sub-par job at something he needs to be doing his best at whether he's he 's flirting or trying to ask you out or not he ought to put quality first", "this is after all his business and if he wants you to remain a customer why on earth is he doing shoddy work", "epm anyone dealt with it", "might be something different", "i have the opportunity to pick up a super nice 6 year old for free", "he's he 's not lame but he's he 's been having issues", "here's here 's what the owner has said", "i have a 5 year old that lost all of his cheek muscle on the right side about 3 4 months ago", "i chalked it up to possible nerve damage because this is what the vet thought and the other cheek muscle was fine and he had no theeth problems", "so i sent him to the trainers the first of september to be started on the barrels", "i got him back the first of the month and he had lost some weight but attributed that to be worked everyday i expected him to drop some", "he is now losing the cheek muscle on the left side of his face and seems to be dropping weight by the day", "had him to a dentist yesterday and there is no teeth problems", "he can eat all his feed and doesn't does n't drop any but cannot can not eat hay from lack of muscle to chew it", "he is gant looking in his flank area and is losing topline muscle", "the only neurological sign that he shows is that he barely drags his toes and sometimes has trouble with his right lead", "the horse i had posted about a couple weeks ago with the atrophied cheek muscles is down to his last resort for life", "i cannot can not afford to treat whatever is wrong with him", "no i have not done an epm test but have done an extensive blood panel and my vet did a neurological physical exam", "we elected to not do the epm test because there was no neurological signs", "he is still showing no signs other than the weight loss and some muscle atrophy", "he eats all of his grain but it just takes him a while to get it chewed because of the lack of muscle in his jaws", "so i might get the horse and see what i can do", "i will be getting with my vet first and if i do get him have the spinal fluid test done for epm and a titer test", "will be getting a copy of the blood results the owner has already ran as well", "my other theory would be wobblers", "i'll i 'll be having my equine chiro acupuncturist out to do some work as well if i do get him", "so any ideas", "think i should do it", "arby", "horse is out of state and not local", "owner is willing to meet me half with him", "i will be calling my vet and chiro about him", "worse comes to worse i'm i 'm out of the and have to put him down anyway or have a pretty pasture ornament", "he's he 's still rideable currently and not having many issues under saddle", "this is a horse that i otherwise wouldn't would n't be able to afford and even if i spend 2 k and treatment i come out ahead of his purchase price", "i posted what the owner as said in paragraph 2 & 3 that is not me to clarify", "she is the one that can't ca n't afford to do anything else for him in case he doesn't does n't recover fully", "he can eat grain and i already have a feed regimen in my head for the guy since he can't ca n't eat regular hay", "i don't do n't think it will be hard to keep his weight up so long as he can eat the grain", "i am not going to go pick up a horse i can't ca n't afford", "i am willing to pull the epm test and treat", "the owner is the one who is unable", "i will also be having my other vet up who's who 's a chiro & acupuncturist to evaluate him for wobblers", "july is when he started to exhibit slight symptoms and the owner and vet originally thought it was just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury", "he's he 's only exhibited weight loss and some muscle atrophy with the slight toe drag and a bit of trouble with the right lead which could or couldn't could n't be related", "the horse is not in pain", "he's he 's not starving", "he's he 's dropping we", "the horse is not in pain", "he's he 's not starving", "he's he 's dropping weight but most of that came from being at the trainers trainer s and being ridden hard for 60 days", "he's he 's not putting it back on", "i know that i have the possibility of treating him and still having to put him down", "at the same time i do know people who have had horses come back successfully after epm", "i know this is going to be expensive", "i'm i 'm willing to give it a shot", "gallop i've i 've already read that whole site and been reading through research articles from the research colleges as well", "looked at studies treatment options and such", "i will have the epm test done before treating", "the chiro acupuncturist will be there to evaluate the horse for wobblers which is often caused by spinal compression and can be confused with epm", "if that is the case then acupuncture isn't is n't going to hurt him", "it's it 's actually one of the alternative therapies for epm", "i think it is wonderfully responsible that you are going into this rescue eyes open and are getting the opinions of qualified professionals and a bunch of yahoos before you decide to take this horse on", "i do think some y!a users need to work on their reading comprehension as i can't ca n't comprehend how taking a horse in as a rescue and getting it qualified medical treatment is abuse", "worst case scenario you fall in love and after spending thousands of dollars you have to put the horse down", "is that something you are up for", "if so go for it and i'll i 'll give you all the moral support i can as you figure out what is up", "it is heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down but some horses are worth the risk", "if you feel this guy is worth it then i hope your vet can figure things out", "as to epm like shee said being in mi we've we 've had to deal with it", "pretty much every large stable has here", "our first diagnosed epm horse was back when there was no treatment in the us and only an experimental chicken feed additive in canada", "we hauled the horse to windsor and got him treated there", "that horse returned to racing and we didn't did n't notice much difference", "we've we 've had a few since then but none since our race horses began wintering in florida", "i have no idea if that is related or farmers are doing a better job of clearing out opossums now because they know opossums are carriers but we haven't have n't had an epm horse in at least 10 years", "i can say all of our epm horses were treated early when they were showing mild signs like shee gave and all returned to racing", "one horse even got his lifetime mark after being treated for epm", "we've we 've always liked big long trotters that do better on mile tracks then 1 2 mile", "the only difference we noticed is that the epm horses seemed to do worse on the smaller tracks after", "it might just be coincidence or the fact those great big trotters with those extremely long backs lost a bit of fine coordination to get those gangly bodies around those tighter turns", "i don't do n't know", "msu does a lot of epm studies because of how common it is here", "you may want to see if you can get in touch with their epm group and get this guy in a study", "i know they did lab work showing that strongid c used daily could help prevent epm", "i believe they have a real study testing the lab work in real world situations now but it may be some time before those results are released", "another thought with this being a mosquito season from hell could it be west nile", "west nile can cause epm like symptoms and doesn't does n't always include a fever", "let us know what you decide to do", "you hate to see talent get wasted but honestly i don't do n't think i could take in a horse right now these issues", "personally i think you should just keep on walking by", "you should have you chiro out before you decide if you want this horse or not", "if you have a good repoire which i'm i 'm sure you do with them they should be honest on if this horse is fixable to any degree not really sure what you want to do with him", "even if you can figure out what is wrong with this poor poneh there is always the chance for remission and then relapse so you may have to do deal with again in the future", "so all in all put the money up front before taking on this horse", "a few hundred out of pocket now will possibly save you thousands once the horse is in your name", "could he have had a blow to the head causing this atrophy", "or a difficult birth", "was it always like this", "or has it occurred since birth", "i also wonder if he might have had a slight stroke", "i think if you cannot can not afford to get him treated that you should not consider him as a prospect", "who knows what the future might hold and it might be expensive", "extremely bad customer service", "do not go to this salon especially if you have to get your hair straightened",

tempura roll was actually a great surprise cheap and delicious the only thing we tried that i would say was well worth it and a great value and i never get vegetarian rolls", "the other rolls weren't were n't at all special especially given their pricing", "the bottom line is that the food isn't is n't great and is relatively high priced", "the service is solicitous the atmosphere is nice and mod

fend for myself but when i had to listen to a non-violent domestic fight that lasted from 1 am to 5 am during my last stay and i found out that the front desk was unmanned during night hours my choice was to either waste tax payers money by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel or just get over it", "i chose the later but approached the front desk about the hotel policy to push

to say the value of this place always amazes me", "it's it 's nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that has upscale service amazing atmosphere and incredible food but not break the

nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece", "i said i was going to trash it also and could i at least have a credit", "with a smirk on her face she told me no money is being returned and that is the way it was", "do not use this company", "there are to many people that need our business to have to put up with this unfair treatment", "i would never recommend this gym to anyone and unfortunately this is based solely on the owner's owner 's own unprofessionalism", "when i originally joined in january i only did so because i was told i would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if i was to move away", "i signed up with one of the staff who was very pleasant and professional", "actually working out there was good the machines are nice and the classes are fun", "the locker room is certainly lacking i would never shower or change there", "they need to update the locker rooms asap", "back to my poor rating i was excepted to medical school and went in to cancel my membership as i was told i could do since i was moving away", "the owner was very rude accused me of not reading my contract and basically told me to shut up when i was trying to ask questions to further understand the process of canceling my membership", "i was able to cancel it but only after paying a 50 fee which the staff person who signed me up stated i would not have to pay if i had proof of moving and being spoken to in a very belittling manner", "i would understand if i was being treated this way by a staff member but the club's club 's actual owner", "bad for

had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from la named derrick", "after he already put product on my hair he said i should warn you i'm i 'm expensive", "what was i supposed to do say i can't ca n't afford you and walk out with crap all over my hair", "i wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown", "the other stylists around me kept pressuring me saying he's he 's so wonderful you're you 're going to love your hair", "400 later my jaw dropped when the receptionist told me the total", "derrick did a terrible job was a complete jerk the entire time and i had no warning as to the price", "i cried the entire way home", "he then fixed it for free but it still looked like crap", "i will never go back", "it was the salon

for", "i expected to pay for this service but imagine my surprise when i received a bill for more than what i paid to have the original return prepared", "asked why rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment it was an amended to show that i had purchased a home nothing out of the ordinary one would think and that took time to figure out", "well that was strike one", "i wasn't was n't going to use them again but i was going to leave it at that", "however now that i have come to realize that i am going to owe the irs 6,000 despite doing exactly what rod told me to do

yet but this is not what i had in mind when hired these guys", "in the words of my new accountant they let me down", "bit sketchy sporadic delivery times", "i bought about half of the furniture i own from this place", "why", "because they cut me good deals if i paid in cash", "sketchy right", "well they came through and delivered almost all of my items within a few days", "they even got me a couch pretty quickly", "the guy who was cutting me the deals and getting me the furniture quickly ahmed was nice and mostly professional except the semi-sketchiness", "then one day ahmed left the country not to return for months without informing me", "he also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that i had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in",

anger", "if i could give them a lower rating than poor i would", "on august 21st 2009 i ordered furniture from hickory furniture mart and contracted for hds to deliver it", "after seventeen days the delivery van showed up at my home minus two pieces", "i was later told they had been left at the warehouse and some future date they would be delivered", "no one will give me a date", "i spent 2300 on the bedroom suite which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor", "upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged a piece of wood was broke on the headboard the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall and a nighstand was missing a drawer", "how do you lose a drawer", "after complaining on september 10th to national home furnishings boyles the hickory furniture mart and home delivery service the latter finally called me back and said they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned", "the customer service at home delivery service was terrible let alone their promise to proper set up furniture", "so i am in limbo regarding a bedroom suite", "i hope the owners and employees of this store have broken bedroom

school", "i was involved in a car accident 20 years ago and since then i've i 've been a nervous wreck and haven't have n't been behind the wheel", "unfortunately a family emergency required me to conquer this fear", "a very good friend of mine highly recommended the professional driving school and i was told to specifically ask for gerry", "she highly recommended him and described him as the saintly instructor and simply the best instructor there is very calm pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions", "i called the school most probably 10 times before i finally enrolled in a 20 hour package", "i had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson", "five minutes before my initial lesson i got a call from gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as i was ready", "my heart pounded as i walked down and pounded even faster upon seeing gerry in an suv lexus", "i thought of canceling the lesson once again because i didn't did n't feel comfortable driving an suv", "gerry pleasantly said since i am already here why don't do n't we give it shot", "i trust you and believe that you'll you 'll be able to handle this and all you have to do is to reciprocate", "trust me and most especially trust and believe in yourself", "don't do n't worry i'll i 'll take care of you", "the rest was history", "here i am now driving confidently on my own", "gerry i can't ca n't thank you enough for helping me cope with my

while to find one that we liked", "but we don't do n't just like house of joy we love it", "everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other chinese restaurant in the san antonio area we have been to and trust me we have been to a lot of them", "we just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the bexar county tax office off of bandera road", "we stopped in and got some take out and cannot can not stop going back", "they have the best egg drop soup i have ever tasted", "we also love their egg rolls and spring rolls", "and every entree we have ordered is perfect", "everything is always cooked fresh and tastes fresh", "their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive", "the staff is also just so pleasant to deal with", "they are also quick at getting your order out to you", "you don't do n't have to sit and wait around forever like most places", "so anyone looking for an excellent night out for chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because i promise you 2 things you won't wo n't regret it", "and you will go back for more", "karla ferguson granger", "ps i have noticed on here that someone left a comment that all of the nice comments must come from workers or friends and i will tell you that i don't do n't know these people except from eating at their restaurant", "we are from virginia and just moved here a year ago", "so that comment is completely false", "because we think it's it 's the best", "and we don't do n't know them except for eating there", "dr. strzalka at flagship cvts is not a good doctor", "i am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there but i do know from personal experience that dr. christopher t. strzalka is not a man of his word and is also very cruel and uncaring", "he was going to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis", "i had a surgery date of july 17 2008", "then he renigged when he read my health care proxy even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery as he had twice stated i must agree to", "he later said that by 2 months he meant at least two months", "two months and at least two months are totally different things", "he did not even give me the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer which i would have", "a health care proxy is not written in stone and can be changed", "he also never even said he was sorry", "just said i was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room", "so therefore now he says i am inoperable even though i am not 100 inoperable and he is letting me die", "i am just middle aged and do not want to die but thanks to this doctor i have no other alternatives", "i along with my friends consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he is not even trying to save my life by operating", "even my pa i went to the other day said it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you", "he said it sarcastically", "if you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need when they will not work for you go to this doctor he is the one for you", "what you can learn from the below bad experience", "i would suggest not avoiding second home based on the bad experience review", "i'd i 'd probably be more inclined to board my two dogs here seeing that they don't do n't just take every dog coming in", "i've i 've toured this place and was impressed by how clean the place was and all the options for the dogs", "it's it 's unfortunate that bmil believed that his perfect dog was not given the right opportunity to prove himself", "but i've i 've done hundreds of dog introductions myself another place i don't do n't work here and owners can have unrealistic expectations and views of what they see when their dogs meet other dogs", "workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively and it's it 's good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem", "it sounds according to your own statement that they had a roomful of dogs so they must be doing something right and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems", "you say you work a lot and that you have a young dog so i have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn and it is good of you to look for a place to take him", "but not at a risk to other people's people 's pets", "you were clearly given another alternative by second home to board him which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from second home a couple times getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later", "no business is going to push customers away without good reason so isn't is n't it reasonable to think they might know what they're they 're doing", "my dogs are far from perfect and one of them i believe would be a little much for daycare here herself at least initially", "be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this and maybe don't do n't jump to personal attacks suggesting that they don't do n't want to work hard just because you bruised your own ego", "dumbest f'ers ever", "i called dominos tonight it rang forever i get put on hold twice without saying a word and finally someone says may i help you", "so i say i'm i 'm at the radison warwick hotel in rittenhouse square built in 1926 do you deliver to the warwick", "they say no warwick in new jersey call new jersey", "i laugh and say no that warwick is in new york but i'm i 'm at the radison warwick", "and he says you're you 're at warwick in pennsylvania", "and i said yes center city philly and he says no warwick is a township if you're you 're at a radison in warwick thats that s too far try dominos in pottstown", "i say no i am at the radison warwick hotel in rittenhouse square", "he says i not know that town i have to get to work i'm i 'm in philly", "call dominos in your town", "i say listen i'm i 'm at 17th and locust do you deliver there", "he says i have to have an exact address", "ok 1701 locust street i say", "he says why you tell me your you r in warwick township", "he gives the phone to a girl she says i have to have your address i say do you deliver to 17th and locust she says your exact address i say 1 7 0 1 locust are you sure she asks", "yes i am sure well she says is that on 17th street", "yes i say", "17th like over by 16th and 15th yes i say one mile west of you", "you're you 're at 7th", "i am just south of walnut", "she says is that 17th like over past broad", "yes i am west of broad", "broad i say is 14th street and i am 3 blocks west of broad and one south of walnut", "hmmm she says then why are you calling here we don't do n't go past broad", "anyway after much yelling and cussing i hung up grabbed a cab and went to geno's geno 's", "quick to take money but not quick to fix a problem", "b&b came out very quickly to give us our quote back in june", "they were very polite eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence", "our fence was installed quickly in august and they had their money and left saying workmanship is guaranteed for a year", "within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in", "we called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of", "we heard nothing", "we then called the office and the man we spoke to said he'd he 'd send someone out to look at it but couldn't could n't promise when two weeks came and went and we heard nothing", "i just called again and was told that workmanship not wood is guaranteed for a year well in my opinion the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship", "she even went so far as to say your you r calling about one board", "well when you pay over 1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good", "yes", "i was calling about one board", "i'm i 'm very frustrated at this point it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once was a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer", "so i figure if they don't do n't want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then i'll i 'll take the time to let everyone i can know about how they treat customers once they have your money", "stay away", "you get what you pay for", "they came in under a lot of other quotes and now i know why", "when the fence was first installed i would have given them five stars now for their poor customer follow up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one star in my opinion", "lots of rules phantom innkeeper last minute price was worth it", "i called the 207 number and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before i gave up", "i then called the 800 number which was answered and inquired about last minute rates", "they had a room with a 99 rate which i booked", "the room was supposed to be on the 2nd floor but they put us on the 3rd", "the email confirmation which i read in the car warned about large suitcases declaring that we are innkeepers not longshoreman", "in other words they do not help with suitcases but they promise totes to help", "however upon our arrival no one there the inn was open", "so no totes", "finally a chambermaid stuck her head around the corner from the top of the stairs and told us sternly that we could not be accommodated until 3 m no exceptions", "then she was gone", "we returned after 3 pm found no one there and a note from the innkeeper with directions to our room", "rules in the room 1 if you drink the soda from the fridge in your room you must prove it by leaving the can in the trash", "if they think you've you 've taken a soda from your room home with you they will charge you 1.50 per can", "they count the cans in the trash to make sure", "2 if you take the shampoo products home they will charge you 8 per item", "if you want a late checkout after 11 am they charge you 15 for the first hour charge 25 for the second hour and after 2 pm it's it 's a full day charge", "4 breakfast is 8 am to 10 am", "no earlier and no later", "if you go later it's it 's all cleaned up", "by whom i don't do n't know", "i never saw anyone there", "all these rules are posted in the rooms", "snacks uninspired bread tea backs and individual coffee things for a machine that didn't did n't exist", "i put the coffee thing in hot water and settled for a cup of weak coffee", "no wine glasses", "room was clean but had a weird dated sink stove combo that didn't did n't work",

are right off the kitchen so you hear everything", "free parking", "i'd i 'd go back if i could get the last minute rate again of 99 but i wouldn't would n't pay their rack rate", "quit with the overstatements", "the worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that everyone is going to love the food decor and service", "the truth is in my and my dining partners' partners ' experience this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food", "it's it 's an entirely up and down experience however", "now the best of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal", "the salatim salads are the smallest plates i've i 've ever seen placed in front of me you would most likely think they were condiments if it weren't were n't explained to you", "though they are mostly excellent you generally don't do n't get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them", "that being said the laffa and hummus are out of this world", "then again for the three of us who dined together two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more and licking the hummus from our fingers and yes those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three person order", "dinner was also an up and down experience", "the vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot on while the lamb was often dry and or overcooked", "the duck was a 65 glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments", "dessert was hmmm that's that 's interesting i don't do n't even remember dessert", "i guess that tells you a lot", "oh yes the chocolate semifreddo was quite good", "the warm chocolate cake was very tasty but served at room temperature not warm by any stretch of the imagination", "and my no i still don't do n't remember what i had", "service was average but nothing special and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly not merely capable", "perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests and as the many golden reviews seem to attest we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience", "but one should not go here expecting something fantastic unless perhaps you've you 've never had middle eastern food before or succulent duck tasty lamb decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts", "ps when we called for a reservation we were told that 5:00 and 9:30 were their only openings", "when we arrived at 5 and left circa 7 there were the same 4 or 5 empty tables surrounding us", "did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience", "must read do not waste your time in this store", "at my appointment the girl helping me was unable to adequately lace up some of the dresses", "they felt like they were going to fall off of me and it was very difficult to see what i would actually look like were i to purchase some of these dresses", "i thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that i liked would look like on a model by looking the dress up online", "so as i was leaving i asked for the designer dress name or style number associated with my top picks", "they said they were unable to tell me until they ordered my dress", "hmmm a person cannot can not call a company if you have no idea its name since the designer is unknown supposedly and order a gown without a dress name or style number", "do other brides fall for this", "they either a don't do n't want to give it to me because they don't do n't want me purchasing the dress elsewhere or b are recreating the dresses themselves ie stealing other designers' designers ' dress designs and filling the orders by their own seamstresses", "i'm i 'm no detective but uhh seriously", "whatever type of operation they are running i'm i 'm not interested and if you're you 're smart you won't wo n't be either", "what a waste of time", "aside from that little mystery one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong i was about how another dress that i loved compared to one of her dresses that i was trying on", "somehow since she supposedly doesn't does n't know any names of designers dresses after i told her the designer and dress name of the one i was comparing she knew exactly which dress i was referring to and disagreed with my observation she said that the bodice did come as low as the one i had on", "my point even if i was wrong don't do n't sit there and argue with the customer", "say something like huh", "i didn't did n't think so but you could be right", "unless you want to take the tell the customer how wrong she is and try and force her into a dress she's she 's obviously not loving approach which will likely get you uh nowhere", "seriously do not waste your time", "other shops around this city have much nicer and more transparent owners", "not owners that seem like they have something to hide and know nothing about common courtesy and customer service", "i felt very much like wedding gallery was being dishonest and i wouldn't would n't trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown i will wear on the most important day of my life", "awful service", "after happily visiting sear's automotives in the past i was shocked at the horrible service received at their greensboro location", "i brought my car in on a sunday to replace a shredded tire", "i waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop that is apparently what you are supposed to do but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage so you don't do n't see them drving up and they purposely block the front pull up that all other sear's use", "once inside i had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before finally a technician got to me", "once i returned to pick up my car you can believe i spent quite a bit more time standing around waiting", "i had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since i was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this wasn't was n't possible", "once i actually got back in my car it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel", "ok one bad experience fine", "the following friday i returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires which were worn", "i would not have gone back but i couldn't could n't find the particular tire they'd they 'd used in stock anywhere else", "once again i waited for quite a bit before being attended to", "i got the order completed and then questioned the technician since it came out about 40 less than i expected", "he said it was the same tire and verified this after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week", "however when he printed out the service quote i could see that it was not the correct tire and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model", "so i pointed this out to him at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock", "ok fine", "so i got just my other rear tire replaced", "they promised it'd it 'd be done within an hour so i waited in the lobby", "over two hours later and ten minutes before they closed my car was finally finished", "a few minutes after i left i was called and informed that i left my wheel lock which they should have left in the car", "of course they would be closing in 5 minutes so i would have to hurry up or get it the next day", "of course i couldn't could n't make it back in time and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me", "the next day no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in", "of course they couldn't could n't call him either to ask about it because apparently they don't do n't keep their employees' employees ' phone numbers riiight so i would have to return on monday driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should i get a flat", "on monday i called and again it was a big to do to find anyone who knew anything about it", "supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening but i'm i 'm sure that will also be a huge ordeal", "the employees at this sear's are completely apathetic and there didn't did n't seem to be any sort of management that i could see", "i will never return there again and now have some serious doubts
