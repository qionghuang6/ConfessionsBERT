Its a game where everyone is dealt 3 cards and you make a 3 card poker hand, and 9s and 3s are wild. In 3 card poker at least the way I was taught, trips is best, then straight flushes, then the same as regular poker.  There is a draw in Nine Three, but you HAVE to draw two cards.   There is no betting, you play for the pot. If you play and lose, you match the pot. If 5 people play and lose, everyone matches the pot. You have to beat the top 3 cards off the deck to win, as well as the other players.   Anyways, we got bored with Nine Three and decided that it would be funnier if we played 2s and 3s wild and called it The Dirty Diaper. Well that wasnt degenerate enough, so then we made it so that your first card is dealt face up, and if its a wild, you HAVE to play for the pot, but you can still decided to draw or not. You are allowed to bow out of the game if the pot becomes too large for your comfort, but it has to be before the hand is dealt.  Well that wasnt degenerate enough, so we decided that your first TWO cards will be dealt face up, and if either is a wild, you are forced to play. We call this version Explosive Diarrhea. We have recently added One eyed jacks as wilds as well, which we call Explosive Jackhammer.

Turn comes 7c, and I continue to barrel given I still have a massive range and nut advantage. He makes the call again.   The river comes a Jh, completing any flush my opponent may have been looking for. Do you continue to triple barrel given the river Or do you give up in this spot", "I cant believe youre worried about the draw coming in on the river meanwhile seemingly ignoring the fact villain was willing to continue when you cbet a paired flop that you missed.   Yes you have the range advantage but the board is also paired.  I proceed with extreme caution when a villain is willing to continue on a paired board. Sure there is lots of holdings in villains range that dont include a K, but if theyre willing to call the flop I tend to slow down and check the turn because if they do have a K, youre dominated. Just setting yourself up to get trapped. Id rather control the size of the pot at that point. Im ok with the continuation bet on the flop, but only as a strategy to win the pot right there because usually on a paired board like this where they dont have a K the villain will fold unless theyre on a pocket pair mining for the boat.", "I think youre overestimating your advantages on this board.", "What suits were the A and Q Whether you cbet flop in this position could depend on what blockers you have to his continuing range. Having the As in this spot means more than Ad. Cbet is probably fine, but his continuing range likely consists of flush draws, middling pocket pairs, and stronger Ax with Ah. Id expect to get raised at least some portion of the time with boats, trips, and low flush draws if your opponent is playing close to GTO. Player type matters a lot here, if you think your opponent will raise with most of his flush draws, its likely you are up against non believing Ax or TT44. Suited connectors with no BDFD get folded on the flop.   Your opponents turn calling range will be player dependent, but you are relatively polar, so his bluff catchers will be once again be something like 88TT. A7hh will improve and continue. 77 makes a set. Overall, this card is going to favor your opponents range and I would likely give up on this turn card if I do not have the correct blockers to his continuing range.   Is your opponent going to raise sets, trips, or boats on the turn If so, you can cap his range as Nut flush draws, Pair plus FD, and middle pairs which are bluff catchers. Ax will fold to a turn bet here. If your opponent will call some of the time with stronger hands, you will be up against a range which is going to be quite strong on the river. Your sizing on the turn matters quite a bit as well.   As for the river, I would triple barrel for a large sizing against certain opponents who are more likely to have a capped range in this spot, targeting bluff catchers like TT88 and 6655. 77 will not fold here. JJ is a hand that you could have that might be played this way as well, so you could represent it. In fact, if you bet this river, you probably want to bomb it for a huge overbet, maybe even targeting flushes. If your opponent is likely to call down with any flush, or 3 of a kind, Id probably give up, assuming they didnt raise it on the turn. You are basically at the bottom of your range here, so it is bombfold or checkfold. Which action you take depends on villain tendencies.", "Against a passive fish I usually check this board oop and just try to get to showdown cheap. Against a table with more solid opponents I rack up lol.", "As played, Id just give up. Youre beating absolutely none of Vs calling range at this point. Heart draws got there, and any Kx had you drawing close to dead on the flop.", "Checking frequently here on the turn. If youre wondering whos range the river card favours, its supposed to favour his pf calling range technically, but if youre check calling the flop and turn, or betting the flop and check calling the turn, its favouring you.  If you bet into him twice on the flop and turn and he has a king and you decide to jam the river, hes gonna snap call. Gotta fold the turn to large bets which he should be making if you check most of the time.", "BTN likely has KQKT, 33,77 and JJ all played this way that are never folding.  They also likely have TT,99,88,66,55,44,22 that might fold to a final barrel on the river.  If you hold the Ah of Qh you remove a lot of their flush combos making a flush less likely.", "Depends. Betfold. Checkcall. It really is situation dependent.", "You dont have a nut advantage. If he has a boat which you cant have youre screwed.

You want to still have a jam that creates fold equity, so that means you shouldnt try inflating the pot on a whim.   On the turn, why are you betting 150  Either jam or check. Check would have been the better play with the line you took prior. You have a weak A and nut flush draw. If you thought the A helped you more than it helped him, check it back and see the river. Mind you, based on this hand, he could have had any premium Ax hand as well as the hand he had.   Again, you need to look at how you played the hand versus should you folded in that spot.

So look at that range. You want him to continue, not fold, with worse flush draws that are now drawing virtually dead, maybe they have a gutshot or Th9h, and theyll have 99KK that will now struggle vs. such a large turn size. Those pocket pairs have 2, or just 1 out if they dont have a heart.  Id bet half pot on the turn or even less. All your value on the flop is still nutted, he just improves to AA but thats 15 or less of his range, and now your nut flush draws get there. Much of your flop bluffs just became value and he wouldve folded ATAK on the flop to your raise. So you cant bet large as he has a very weak range outside specifically A8s, or some sets that dont 3bet.

I know this is fundamental and basic but I just cant get my head around the math of percentage winning vs odds. And I fear that I have just fundamentally misunderstood something so basic.", "You dont want to modulate your bet sizings based on your equity chance of winning in the hand. Equity helps you to determine whether you can call a bet from your opponent. For example, if your opponent bets the size of the pot on the river, you have to win 33 of the time for it to be a profitable call. This means when deciding whether to call you want to figure out if your hand beats 13 hands of what they could be betting bluffs and value. If you have a draw on the flop or turn, you can apply the same concept. For example if you have a flush draw and your opponent bets the size of the pot on the turn, you only have about 20 chance of winning the hand but you need 33 for it to be a profitable call. However, sometimes it can be worth it to make the call if you believe that you can be paid enough on a large bet if you hit your flush to offset the times you miss the draw. Thats a concept called implied odds. Without over complicating things, implied odds means that you can sometimes make calls where you arent getting the right price if you and your opponent have enough money behind that they can call a large bet on later streets.

What you wrote makes no sense at all.  Sorry to be blunt, but you have no shot.", "What", "Youve got it backwards. If you know you only have a 25 chance of winning, why on earth are you thinking about raising for value You dont. Rather, you use pot odds to help determine whether to call that 10 bet, and to know that we need to know the size of the pot.   If you figure you have 25 equity in the hand, that gives you 31 drawing odds, so to call profitably you need pot odds of 31 or better. So suppose there was 20 in the pot before the flop, and villain bets 10 post. Theres now 30 in the pot, and the cost of a call is 10. Thats pot odds of 31. So yes, you can call.  On the other hand, suppose there was only 10 in the pot, and villains 10 bet is pot sized. Now youre looking at betting 10 to win 20, so your pot odds are now 21.

Runouts where the obvious 2 pair combo JTs in this case gets counterfeited and only you have the overpairs are great for preflop aggressor.

QQ can all shove too, JTs, full houses. 26 value combos. Vs a small flop stab you can have a lot of AK that xc and if you bluff without a club Ac or Kc not blocking AJsKJs, that would be still underbluffing but good enough for balance. Then you can draw on AQs without clubs to get to 10 bluff combos as you keep climbing.  The only negative thing about your bluffs most naturally coming from AKAQs is that these hands can win at showdown.

Well if they missed the flop, theyre going to fold to a bet, often regardless of amount. You need to find the sweet spot and try to find the smallest amount that will get them to fold. But if all your Cbets are more than half the pot when youre bluffing, youre lighting money on fire.  There are many factors that influence the decision to CBet or not when you want opponent to fold  Flop texture. If board is very dry example K72 rainbow, you should only need to bet small. Villain cant have TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AK or AA otherwise he would have reraised preflop. The only hands he can possibly call to a cbet is 77, 88, 99 or 22. Those are only 18 possible combinations. There are no draws on that flop. So a perfect flop to cbet on and you only need to bet a small amount. A third pot will take this down if villain missed.  If flop is very wet example T97, you should probably avoid cbetting if you miss.  Number of opponents  When multiway, its harder to get more than 1 opponent to fold. If you whiff, you should be more inclined to check.   If youre a new cash player, I recommend you follow Peter Clarkes From the ground up cash course on RunItOnce. Its 50 I think.

I also include money in my bank and stock as part of my bankroll as well as the cash that I have. Not sure if any of you factor those in when determining if you are properly rolled for a game  I dont include my retirement accounts or assets car as part of my bankroll as I cant access that money.  I also think for live poker you would need at least 40 BI to play professionally, I have a job but I wont play in games if I dont have 25 BI as calculated above", "Buying in for 300 bb as opposed to 100 bb doesnt necessarily linearly increase bankroll requirements. For most pots the extra chips dont materially affect the results.  For a winning professional, buying in deeper will increase win rate with diminishing returns at the cost of more variance. To some degree the increased win rate will hedge the additional variance.   For a recreational or part time player bankroll doesnt really matter. Its either a budget instead of a bankroll, or the risk of ruin doesnt really matter.   For a professional that derives the majority of their income from poker, and does not have a way to easily replace that income, 100 buy ins as defined by 100 bb is a minimum reasonable bankroll requirement to not move down in stakes. This is not absolute and there are other factors. For buying in deeper I would want to add a small coefficient. If you have a high monthly nut you should have more, and likewise with low expenses you can have less. If you have dependents that number should be more.   For a part time player or full time player with a backup plan, keeping your bankroll segregated makes sense. For a full time player without a backup plan its not possible to do this because all the money you have and have access to is in play. It wouldnt make sense to say drop from 1020 to 25 if youve got 500k sitting in a retirement account. Its extra buffer and it counts.   Common numbers for live poker people might say are in the 2550 buy in range, but this is grossly under rolled for the full time player described above. This may be fine for a nondepleting bankroll. For a professional that draws living expenses its not nearly enough.   For example, lets say someone had 50 buy ins at 510, or 50k. It would be expected to go on a 1015 buy in down swing at some point. Is 35k enough to keep playing If the downswing happened over 3 months and you have 3kmonth of expenses you would actually have 26k, is that enough to be comfortable  What if you cant work for 6 months because of getting sick, needing to take care of family, or an unknown like a pandemic happens Its also very possible to break even for 6 months, yes even in live poker as a long time professional.   And this is at 510, 50 buy ins at 25 is only 25k and the risk of ruin is very high. Its why there is a revolving door of young kids that are decent at poker who dont make it. The numbers were stacked against them.   This also doesnt take into account taxes. In order to have 3k to spend on monthly expenses youll need to earn 44.5k. A professional has to pay the full 15.3 tax rate for social security and Medicare which is usually split with an employer. The 100month health care plan through an employer usually costs 500 in reality. A normal 400month family health care plan could cost 1200 without the employer contribution.   Finally, anyone that has the ability to navigate the above and have a successful career through diligent money management could make much more money in numerous other industries. If they ever re enter the normal job market they will have paid a STEEP opportunity cost for losing those years of career development and compound raises.   TLDR bankroll requirements either dont matter for part time or recreational play, or are much higher than people think and start at minimum around 100 BI.", "Youre on the right way.

The problem with the homegames in my area is that 1 stake higher gets 5x more expensive because of al the sickos that play it. 1000bb average stack is not uncommon after just 5 hours of play.", "I agree that you should use your actual buyin to determine the amount of buyins that you have.   Including money in the regular bank account or stock as part of your bankroll seems dangerous to me. I separate my poker money from the rest of my money. I have no intentions of selling stock to go play poker. I do have a special bank account that I only use for poker. Because having all those 100bills in the house is dangerous.   40 buyins to play professionally seems reasonable to me. I try to have 25 buyins at the next biggest game before going up. For me, all available games are 25 some uncapped, but some games play a lot bigger so I just look at the buyin I expect to need there.", "Cool story, bro", "I assume the 700 is a cap because otherwise would make no sense not to buy in for max.

Money that you are willing to put on the table, and potentially lose.  You can buy in for whatever you want, or for whatever the table allows.

The 100 BI number is for a full time player who is using poker for living expenses I.e., a depleting bankroll without an exit contingency, and it includes life roll because I dont really think segregation matters in this case.  3k living expenses 44.5k pretax is like starting each month at 25 on a 9 BI downswing. Then when you go on a 10 BI downswing it is effectively a 19 BI loss for that month. Then the next month starts and you have to start with an additional 9 BI gone, so now you have to win 28 BI just to break even over 2 months. On a skinny roll thats a lot of stress.", "False.

I think its pretty rough to make a living at 25 if your monthly nut is 3k, simply not much way around it. If you hit a downswing before some accumulation, everything can turn ugly pretty quickly.  Fwiw I didnt mean to suggest you can get by with a 20bi liferoll just because you shouldnt swing much at live poker.

Standard open is 18. I can see this player opening bigger to either maximize value against opponents calling too wide KK, AK or for protection 99JJ, ATsAQs.  I flat, feels like Im way ahead or way behind.  CO flats, BTN 3 75. BTN is TAG but his sizing here was garbage and felt super valueheavy.   UTG1 flats, at which point I feel Im way ahead of him. I flat because I think Im behind the BTN. Had he chosen a better squeeze size, I wouldve considered a 4. I flat, CO flats.   Flop Js 7s 3d. Checks through to BTN, BTN bets 150. UTG1 folds.   I hate flatting here because I feel forced to call down on clean runouts. I hate folding because I still think my hand is too strong.   I XR 355 with 555 behind planning to fold to a jam. I think he can only fold or jam I know Im repping super thin here, specifically JJ or 77. I think sometimes, I get better overpairs to fold. He doesnt have combo draws here.  I had been playing for four hours and was lucky to have a 10 VPIP due to card death. I think I can get it through often enough against this player to be profitable. I wasnt worried about the CO.   CO folds, BTN is in agony and eventually folds KK faceup.  Before I get flamed for not 3 pre, my decision was strictly because of UTG1s sizing, and knowing hell barrel most flops. Same reason I didnt 4 BTN. Doesnt make sense to me to bloat the pot.  Do you play it differently and how so   Edit Its a wild home game. Im not taking this line in a normal game or with unknowns.", "There is so much going on this hand dont even know where to start.", "I would say your check raise size on the flop is way too small and leaves you with an awkward SPR, and if Im the villain I am never folding KK getting 41 with a less than pot sized bet behind.  I always wonder with 13 games how good people actually are, clearly you study poker and put a lot of thought into this hand but at 13 Im always shocked by how people play. I tend to read less into my opponents potential range and just play solid and in position.", "If he raised larger this one hand and his worst hand is blatantly JJAK, I can see calling preflop being ok. Its wild there are people raising to match the strength of the hand still.  But then are you just trying to setmine with QQ and hoping he doesnt barrel and put you to a hard decision with missed AK  However if you really thought he had ATs99 then you should be 3betting with QQ. You still dominate most of his range.   Also if you checkraise flop youre intending to call a shove. Youre planning on folding to a shove means he can never be bluffing with a huge combo draw like Ts9s9s8sTs8s4s5s6s5s6s4s which would comfortably do this vs. AJ or even a slowplayed overpair like you have. Ridiculous to think of folding after you checkraise.", "Home games are hard to check because so many considerations go into it when you play with the same people in a more casual setting. Normally, though, the best you can do with QQ vs KK is get away with it, and trying to steal it isnt worth it. You should know youre beat by that preflop action in a normal game, though, and even if youre not sure you shouldnt go 3 ways to a flop sandwiched between someone with probably AK or AQ suited and someone with Aces or Kings or Jacks.   You beat nothing on that flop except AKAQ, which you want to keep in, so the XR makes no sense except as a stone cold bluff. I dont often like the bluff there in a normal game, too spewey, too likely to get calledgotta be able to lay down QQ pre or post flop.", "Definitely 3bet pre. You thought about folding the flop What Why doesnt he have combo draws here Also the range youre repping should include straight  flush draws here so its not all value. This is a very nutty game if people are folding kings in this spot to a single check raise on a draw heavy board. If Im villain I jam every time there over the xr.", "How often do you honestly think an overpair is folding here And Id cut combos in half because any overpair with a spade is for sure calling..", "I usually try to do that, playing tight and in position. However, this home game is wild. Its always 6x pre, and more often than not, multiway. And they play 11 handed.", "I generally agree with your advice here. One thing, he describes BTN as a TAG and his sizing meant his range is even tighter than normal. The population tendency for live low to mid stakes is for 3bets to be heavily weighted towards value. So, Id he surprised if BTN shows up with a lot of those suited connectors as squeezes, particularly the lower ones and gappers.  Still, I think the plan of checkraise flop to fold is absurd, especially turning QQ into a bluff even if he somehow got that to work.", "UTG1 is raising to match the strength of his hand. He absolutely does this. My only point of contention is I think hes weighted more towards top of range being in early position. Hes not built to put me to a tough decision if he bricks with AK. I do think a small 3 is better than flatting though in hindsight. If I get cold 4 from late position, its pretty easy to play.  BTN wouldve chose a squeeze size pre. When he only goes 3x, after two flats, his 3 squeeze should be much larger imo. I think that discounts all the combo draws he could have. If he was trying to take down the dead money, he shouldve at least made it 125. Lends me to think hes quite strong.  I did plan on XR folding because 1 I get to see what UTG does first. If hes trapping with AA, hes going to XR flop all day, then I fold. 2 BTN doesnt have combo draws in his range because of preflop action.  I dont love the way i played it but i dont hate it either. Strictly player dependent. If I call flop, I feel like Im torching 150 because what happens on brick turn cards Do I call off the BTN jam or fold Probably fold at that point. At least if I XR and he flats, Im likely ahead. If he jams over my XR, hes way ahead. Idk lol.  Thanks for your input.", "I agree with most of what you said. In hindsight, I wouldve 3 UTG1 to 60 and folded to the cold 4 from BTN.  Only reason I took a flop was because of the shitty 3x sizing BTN took on his 3. Im getting 31 at 300bb eff, I know CO is calling the 50 more and isnt going to 5.", "It is a very nutty game. Opens to 1823, five ways to the flop almost every hand. BTN wouldve picked a larger sizing pre if he was squeezing, he only has value imo. Especially when he goes 12 pot on flop, just value", "Against this player, I think it gets through 5050. I dont agree that hes autocalling an overpair with a spade. But even if that is the case, that lines up with my thoughts of 5050.  I dont think theres ever a scenario that this player just flats with such awkward SPR. Hes going to jam or fold, thats just what Ive usually seen from him.", "All the more reason to raise pre", "Yea ,tbh I didnt know what the best move on the flop was. Folding felt too nitty and flatting seemed like I was asking for pain. The whole hand kinda sucked.  I do agree turning QQ into a bluff was absurd, but I thought he would fold overpairs half the time vs. me. Still think a better line now woukd be 3 small pre and fold to the inevitable cold 4 from BTN.  Thoughts on that instead", "For him to 3bet small and actually be super nutted is really interesting.  Vs. unknowns Id assume small 3bet size is more likely to have suited connectors, AJs, some suited broadways. Especially if you guys are 300 bb effective. However, you indeed had a good handle on his ranges.  Then the other main area for your review here is, if BTN is very heavy value, is checkraising EV If he doesnt have the combo flush draws, then youre not expecting to be good against a shove, at best vs AsKs or AsQs or something. Then his cbetfold to checkraise needs to come from AK right. Is he someone that would cbet bluff multiway  So if you think hes cbetting too much with AK, then the checkraise punishes him well and folds outdenies 25 equity to AK which is good. If youre always checkraising to only fold out AK, but he shoves with KKAA that youre folding to or getting stacked by, you need him to be stabbing a lot with AK.  Like if he only cbet bluffs with one spade, then has 15 QQKKAAAsKsAsQs then hes cbet bluffing only 621  28 of the time or if he always bluffs AcQc then 722  31. If your preflop read is right he shouldnt have AQo. But I suppose if hes hero folding KK and then only shoving with sets, which would only be JJ that hes 3betting preflop, then checkraising is a money printer.", "Is 31 enough to basically set mine Are you doing this same thing with 66 QQ is basically the same hand as 66 after this action, assuming nobody is getting way out of line with TT. Maybe at best youve got a loose JJ in there that QQ is beating, but you cant really count on that.   And what if CO doesnt want to play 3 ways and pops off with a shove holding AK You say you know hes not doing that so its hard to analyze from the outside because I dont know the dynamics of your home game, but in a normal game its a bad idea imo.", "Idk the player deeply, but Ive played with him a dozen times and think I have a fair handle on his range. He doesnt balance and goes bigger with his bluffs, i.e., he 3  with AKo to 105 after a 30 EP nit open, goes three ways to the flop of 992. Checks to him, he bets 500 and takes it down. He cold 3 600ish on a J98 rainbow four ways after it went bet 50, call call. He had 77.   His sizing tends to match his hand strength in the sense of bluff sizing vs. value sizing. A halfpot cbet is value from him, but if he didnt feel he needed to protect his hand, he shouldve went 13 imo. Or 23 if he wanted to maximize value.   That in between sizing stuck out to me and led me to think I could get folds from AK and better overpairs. Purely an exploit, and maybe too ambitious, but I really thought hed give me too much credit and fold overpairs probably half the time. The other half he jams and I dont lose my entire stack.", "31 direct odds, were 300bb eff though so with implied odds, I think its a profitable call to set mine with most pairs that call the 25 initially.   66 is probably the lowest pocket pair Ill have in EP from an EP raise. When BTN 3xs, Im actually getting 4.51 direct. 50 more to win 225.   CO isnt built like that. If he had a hand that wanted to raise, he wouldve done so to the initial raise, not hope BTN or the blinds raise and then backraise. Tbh, if he does that and BTN and UTG1 fold, Im going to reraise CO.   Most players in this game are loosepassive and play fairly face up. Most of these players cant bluff like that. Earlier I had AdAc vs KK when I was BTN and he was BB. I open to 25 over four limps, SB calls, and BB just flats. We go seven ways to a flop of 2d3d4h. Checks to me, I cbet 55. He XR 150, MP shoves for 250, I jam 320, he sigh calls. MP had a FF that bricked and I scoop.  Didnt love that spot either but I think hes only doing that with overpairs. I know both him and MP well and figured on that board texture, Im ahead enough of the time to go for it considering SPR going to flop was like 1.81. Have better twopair draws, front door wheel and backdoor diamonds. Also only started that hand with around 100bb.", "If button folded KK to the slightest pushback post flop, how is set mining actually even profitable against him Youre assuming youre getting stacks in when that doesnt seem to be the case.", "Because then I just checkcall down as he valueowns himself. He shoves clean turns if I just call. If I call flop, pot is 600, 760 behind. He shuts down on spades or an ace, so 1245. Hell bet big on turn, maybe even shove, to deny equity. So roughly 14 times he shuts down, the rest he continues value betting.  Its not only set mining. I think Im better than these players postflop and can put them in difficult situations. Purely exploitative in this specific game, most of these players have been playing the same way for years.

Because if you just said call and then the dealer proceeded to run out the board without announcing all in or bringing the bets in, well then that dealer is awful. Sounds like he or she is awful either way.  Why would both players just throw in 100 bucks and leave the other 400 combined between the two of you in front of you two  Fuck that player for going all in with 13 of his stack. Put it all in or just verbalize the all in with no chips. Dealer is just asking for a problem and future drama at that point.  If he wasnt angling then  he should have corrected the dealer as well, as it could not have  been obvious to him that the dealer was aware either.  If it happened exactly like you say, then you did absolutely nothing wrong and were put in a bad spot by the dealer.  Players do all kinds of weird shit. Thats why dealers are there to run the game.  TLDR It absolutely is the dealers fucking responsibility to verbally announce all ins. Call the floor next time. Other player may or may not have been angling.

I sat next to guy who tried this sitting next to the dealer his opponent was opposite next to dealer put in a 5, barely whispered all in so only dealer could hear.

Angler said he called And the whole table made a stink about it thankfully so the dude got to only lose 5.", "Stack the chips, dont tip, keep playing and keep quiet. Fuck em. You did nothing wrong.

Thrive on it, let it drive you to even more success. And to repeat fuck em both.", "Hey you got angled by both the dealer and the other player. If its me Ill try to get the dealer fired. That was way out of line. Confront that dealer and get him to admit he said slowrolling is disgusting. See if thats enough to get him fired.", "thats 95 collusion lol dealers dont get upset over somebody slowrolling unless they have a relationship with the vicitm", "In the case it was an angle, if the dealer said its an all in and you immediately turned over your hand the player could argue that it wasnt. You probably wanted clarity from everyone what the action was before you expose your hand because there was obvious confusion. I would say as soon as both the dealer and player confirmed that the action was indeed all in than you can immediately turn over the hand. It sounds like you may have dragged it on a bit longer but you could chalk that up as being a noob in complex situations of possibly being angled.", "Naw fuck that dealer. You didnt slow roll shit, you were just concerned about getting jipped for more value", "Why did the other player not say anything when dealer said that it was actually an all in Possible attempt at collusion maybe", "what is the argument for the dealer here how is hero supposed to know that villain was going allin and not betting the 100 he put in the pot", "Its your lucky day.   Should have stayed to stack the tilted guy again.", "I dont think this is a slow roll. Youre confused as to whether he still had chips behind and obviously you wanted to get more money in the pot once you saw his hand.", "Just tossing out a black chip is a 100, not an automatic all in. You were in the right, but hilarious that all the arguing happened after the fact you knew you won and stacked him", "What amount is the black chip", "Were you wearing head phones or something and possibly missed the all in calls from the other player and dealer Even then the dealer should of passed out the all in button especially since poker first and foremost a visual game but curious if its possible you didnt hear the audible calls.", "Dont tap the glass", "Hold up, can someone explain to this noob how this is a slowroll Also what a slowroll is, and why its frowned upon Based on the google definition this seems like it isnt one because OP called the all in before he even had the flush, and if he put the other guy on having a Q then it seems totally normal to take some time deciding if you wanna bet on getting a flush on the river.", "This happened to me once. They threw in one chip and I raised, which the dealer originally thought was legit. The guy then claimed hed gone all in and my raise was a call.  No one had heard him say it, and floor had to be called. They checked the camera, and hed apparently mouthed the words, so they gave it to him.", "Even if you did slow roll, why is the dealer commenting on it Especially unprofessional given that you made it very clear that you were confused.", "Call the floor lol. The dealer essentially robbed you of money on average", "You dont look at your opponents chip stacks when you are playing", "You played this hand horribly, you should know your opponents stack sizings at all times, and yeah dealer should have thrown the All In symbol", "Once the player turned his hand, and the dealer said he was allin, you should have turned your hand over and discussed it with the dealer later.", "how do you mistake one black chip for about 300 behind", "Not the best on the dealer but you need to know the action and stack depths of your opponents. This isnt your fault per se but blaming the dealer, the extensive back and forth and others talking about calling the floor or collusion is just absurd. There isnt really a need for a lot of back and forth when you have the A high flush and the guy already tabled trips and has no more money. Scoop the pot, apologize for not being on top of the action and move on to the next hand. Also, stop complaining when you stack someone. Own it and move on. This is a game for money, dont complain when you win.", "You really wouldve folded the nut flush to a turn jam Beat all other flushes and trips. It would also be a horrible move for villain to donk jam in that spot but would not love calling", "Dealer is garbage.  But I will say I get the idea that if you have the nuts anyway dont make such an issue about it.", "Sure", "All the rpoker shit regs bashing the dealer. How the fuck are you not aware that Villains total stack consists of 1 black chip", "I hadnt seen my opponent drinking at all.   As far as collusion, my first instinct was that something was clearly off. I cant say for certain why I felt that way, but something was clearly not right. Itd be one thing if I were headphones and hoodied up, but I wasnt and I was sitting closer to my opponent than the dealer was. There is zero percent in my mind still that he verbalized all in. Couldve just been some weird hand gesture angle shoot that I didnt see, but I honestly still dont know what happened.", "Tin foil hat me would also suspect collusion between dealer and opponent  No tin foil hat required.", "They see that shit on high stake streams and try to emulate them.  I play with several idiots that verbalize their thought processes like theyre Gman or something. It would be comical except for the fact that theyre not even trying to get a read or anything. Just telling you exactly whats going on in their low stakes brain while slowing the game way down.  Poker is alive and well. Thank god for HCL.  When I dealt, we were told to kick their single chip back to them since its only purpose is to cause confusion and replace it with the All In button. Or puck lol", "Brad Owen", "The worst part about it was that he had less than 10 chips in his entire stack. Didnt make any sense.", "I do it because I dont want to give a tell. My hands sometimes shake though to be fair they shake when bluffing and when nuttedalso they shake so I can nuthehI digress so to give minimal info away I minimize all my actions at the table. Its less hand motions to put one chip in then it is to push your entire stack in.  Do you push it all in and have them spill Do you grab the stack and put it in one at a time and risk string betting etc.  All gives more info then just outing one chip and saying all in", "honestly, i do this if im jamming a decent sized stack w out afew blacks if i have some big chips ill just raise big enough to cover them but i just dont want to waste time sliding out the stacks lol.", "I literally never bet with a single large chip just to make it clear Im not going all in and Im not calling.  Ill bet 1,100 rather than 1k etc.", "Fortunately the game I play in, when people go allin, they actually shove all their chips over the line.  The only time Ive seen or done myself a single chip flipped into the pot is when making a call.", "Thats when you were either getting angled by the player due to a horrible dealer   I guess horrible includes colluding with the other player and I guess incompetence is possible, so this is correct.", " How did you react to the action on the turn Did you also toss in a chip Or did you announce call   So, I tanked for about 20 seconds or so. There was ample time to have the all in puck come out or have it announced.   I said call and slid out 4 greens afterwards. Dealer didnt pull the chips in, just burned and turned. But 100 if the argument was the player said all in, I was toast because I did say call before putting in 100.   As for saying something to the floor, Im at this same casino every Saturday. Its a newer dealer, but youre absolutely right that I need to speak up about it. Ill mention something to them next Saturday when I come in. I just was tired and crabby, frustrated a bit by the whole ordeal, so I left immediately after.", "Yep, probably this.", "Right.

The more time Ive had to think about it, the more Im realizing it seems worse and worse.", "A slowroll is a trolling technique of hesitating as long as possible to show a winning hand.   The idea is to make the other player think they won the pot, or cause them a lot of suspense, before showing.  Its sometimes acceptable in friendly games where players trash talk and joke around, but is otherwise very bad etiquette.  Its not exactly an angle as it can only be done when you legitimately win the pot, but it is a manipulation designed to tilt someone.    This isnt remotely a slow roll.  The player wanted to bet on the river and was confused by lack of announcement of the all in, which seems to have been inappropriate.  Also A high flush is not the nuts at the river on a paired board.", "Mouthed the words  holy cow", "I do. He just didnt move his chip stack into the middle. He tossed out a black chip.

Even if you do clearly announce all in, there is no legitimate reason to then put in a fraction of your stack.  Announcing clearly and waiting for a response before moving chips is fine.

The obvious goal is to claim, if you lose, that you didnt really announce all in and not everybody heard it and so on.

I have never seen anyone object to this,  ever as long as the chip goes in simultaneously or after the verbal,  and the verbal is clear. Throwing chip in first would be illegal.

If those specific circumstances are true then its not an angle.  Everywhere Ive ever played the announcement was all that was needed.

What distinguishes loss aversion from risk aversion is that the utility of a monetary payoff depends on what was previously experienced or was expected to happen.

Turn comes a 10d and I size up to a bit over 23 to prepare for the river jam, and I get another call from the big blind.   River brings ln the front door flush I believe it was something like the 3s, and villain makes a slightly over pot sized lead jam. I had seen him take this line as a bluff with overcards before when the front door flush came in as a bluff, but I believe it was a bet flop, check turn, he pots with overcards repping the flush, and I just didnt think he was likely turning moderate made hands that would call the turn into bluffs, and the only bluffs I could really think he might be making would be AQ with the ace of spades that made a really light call on the turn, or qj that made a really light call on the flop.

All the overcard draws with a spade or backdoor hearts that just fold on dry acehigh or kinghigh boards which is why the 13rd range cbet works so well on those boards and not on these connected middlelow boards can call too, if its BTN.  Youre technically at the top of your range outside of flushes, but an overpair with a spade is probably higher EV bluffcatcher as long as he is only repping a flush. ie. if he doesnt have a set or 2pair, because he shouldve raised those on flop or turn, and didnt river a 2pair or something, a straight beats the same hand as overpairs.  On a river 3 its unlikely he hit some weird 2 pair combo, so the river call is more about how likely he has a flush. So its ok to fold here.

I dont think I ever fold here if the flop was say, 6s 9s 10h where he probably has a lot of jq and maybe KQ combos that he ends up bluffing.

Based on how tight your opening ranges are, and how the pool doesnt play correct Vs high cbet, you may be able to cbet a bit more often. Sizing matters here.   I suggest linear 3b range and have no cold calling range for few reasons  1. Rake is high. Cold calling pre becomes ev because the pot is smaller and your pot odds decreased.   2. Player pool is not 4b less than nuts so you wont have to fold good equity hands to potential bluffs  3. 3b polar will to some extent rely on single,double,triple barrel bluffs. Those bluffs gain a lot of ev from hitting and winning a big pot. But rake will significantly decrease the size of the pot won and make the bluffs less profitableharder to play.   I.e. 3b 56s, flop A2t with FD. You will likely triple barrel this often but wont win a big enough pot when you hit on the River because rake.   Also, to have a polarized 3b range you have to have a calling range.  Its just best to 3b linear and have hands that flop good equity pairs, overs  draws and be able to bet aggressively and win pots.   Very generally speaking, a linear range would be something like all broadways, most suited aces, 9ts, 89s, all pairs.   Your most powerful tools at microstakes will be 3b then cbet and opening a wide range of hands from the button. Its generally hard to make a big mistake by over doing it as well.

You would need 3334 buyins to cover the prize pool and you got the extra 5k from having the 10 rake. This would be a tournament that completely runs itself and you get 5k profit. But since were getting that profit we actually dont need to reach the 3334 buyins. We can be lower than that by a few hundred buyins and still profit because of the rake we took.  for example say we only get 3100 buyins.. the prize pool would be 46,500, with a guaranteed of 50k so were losing 3,500 right Not quite, because if we add the 10 rake to it which would be 4,650  46,500  51,150 which is actually now higher than the prize pool, so we still profited.", "This is always something I didnt understand and feel like happens more with live tourneys why are they allowed to say its a 10k guarantee as an example if they dont hit the right amount of people they just adjust the prize pool lower than 10k If I understood that right .

What do you guys recommend", "Ive been stuck at 50NL on Pokerstars since June 2021. Having a couple issues that are stopping me moving up. One is that I simply I dont have enough of an edge against the other regulars in the pool. There arent enough fish to rely solely on them to maintain a good winrate. I do not generally see regulars in the pool making huge postflop mistakes. What this means in practice is that if I am not coolering them, then I am probably losing money against them. I have heard a lot about datadriven MDA strategies used by CFPs. These strategies focus on exploiting players in specific pools on specific poker sites. Having access to such strategies allows you to know what spots are underbluffed, overbluffed and underfolded. Not having this information means that, in practice, I am having to guess too often in big pots, particularly in river spots where I need to decide between bluffcatching and folding, or bluffjamming or giving up. I strongly suspect that I am bluffcatching when I shouldnt be, folding when I should be bluffcatching, giving up when I should be bluffing, and giving up when I should be bluffing.  I believe that MDA strategy offers the best chance of improving my decisionmaking in each of these spots and consequently greatly improving my results, and CFPs are the best option for accessing these strategies. The catch is that when you join a CFP, you have to give up a share of your profits. An average estimate from what I have seen is that I would need to give up between 50 to 60 of my profits to the CFP if accepted. I am wondering if this is a fair exchange. I dont feel I am improving enough from watching videos and using solvers. My results actually got worse when I tried to implement GTO strategy. I want to fully commit to playing exploitatively. Also, uForeignTackle8476 has posted graphs showing him skyrocketing through the stakes after previously being stuck at micros. He uses MDA from an offshoot of Poker Detox. I have heard similar stories from other people who have joined different CFPs. One of the problems with playing stakes as low as 50NL is that even if you are a big winner, the money isnt really enough to make a difference to your life. I need to be playing 200NL realistically for it to be worth it.

The GTO part is to know in which ways your opponents deviate from the NE, so they you can maximise your EV from their deviations and hence to play GTO is to make the best play based on your understanding of how your opponents play differently from said baseline. For example, do they call wider in certain spots than what the NE GTOwizard recommends If so, then the GTO play for you is to value bet wider and bluff less than GTOwizard recommends that you do in the same spot. Are they bluffing more in the certain spot than NE recommends Then the GTO play is to call wider than the software recommends.  On your main question. I dont really know or understand staking that much having not encountered it, and I dont play online other than messing about at 10NL occasionally.

But yeah youre going broke here almost every time, just a cooler", "I see a couple of things that could have allowed this hand to end differently.  First, A8 is not a good hand to call with preflip from the small blind against a middle position raiser. There are a couple of things that could change that.  If there are several other callers, for example, or you have have history against this player knowing they raise preflop with a wide range.  Typically, Id probably tend to let this go preflop because A8 is going get you in trouble more often than not against an unknown MP raiser.  Lets say its too late, Ive already made the call.  The board is friendly to my hand, so check is the right play here most of the time.  Opponent bets, but not having enough info on him, I dont know whether to call or raise.  If I think hes a loose cannon, or Im not sure, I probably lean towards raising.  Checkraise gives my opponent info that Im strong, and he could fold. He could also either smooth call or shove indicating a strong hand.  Either way it gives me more info about this player and his holdings.  Lets say I just checkcall the flop with the intention of betting or check raising the turn.  Turn comes, but shouldnt really be a card Im concerned about with the ranges I put my opponent on. I check with intention to raise.  Opponent puts in a larger than pot size overbet.  My plans to checkraise just went out the window, alarm bells going off.   At this point, its important to think through what hands my opponent could have that Im losing to.  AA, JJ, 88, 66, AJ and even 97 are all possibilities with the way the hand has played out so far.  Pocket aces or 8s unlikely since Im blocking some of those hands, but they are still possible.  Of course, its still very possible theyre overplaying an ace, bluffing, or semibluffing with a wide range of hands. Not being sure if what to do here, my tendency would be lean towards fold. Its a good bet for a bluff, but I honestly dont have enough information to put my opponent on a hand.   Lets say I call anyways because I have some indication that my opponent is bluffing, overplaying, or on a draw and Im ahead in the hand.  Theres already a substantial pot around 400 with only a pot size bet behind.  River comes giving me a boat, I make a value bet of 200 and opponent shoves.  Its very unlikely opponent is bluffing since the shove is effectively a value raise.  He knows youre strong and are not folding to a bluff.    You have two choices 1 replay the way the hand played out in your head and make the hero fold 2 take your lumps and make the call.  After all, its still possible hes overplaying a big ace and thinks he has the best hand  I think if Im this far in, I have to make the call, even if its more likely than not that Im beat.  Theres still a chance I could have the best hand.  The way I see it, there were a couple different ways to get away from this hand. That said, keep in mind that knowing the opponents cards and having time to analyze this after the fact is far easier than playing this out in real time.

This will make it harder for them to have informationreads they need to effectively bluff you and will make it easier for you to bluff them, call their bluffs, and get value from your strong hands.  2 Tighten up and play a tighter range  this one slightly sucks but it is one of the key adjustments for playing against overly aggressive players. By doing less limping and opening tighter you will bleed less money when these players make large preflop raises, 3 bets, and cbets. With larger preflop raises relative to stack size intuitively you also want to be playing more snug. By showing up with a stronger range in general you will more often have the best hand at showdown and can more confidently call their bluffs or thin value bets.  3 Slow Play  as a general rule I dont slow play much but against very aggressive opposition who will value bet thinly and massively overbluff mixing in some slow plays with your strong hands and giving them rope to hang themselves easiest to do from in position is one of the most effective ways to extract value.  These players will often get suspicious and foldgive up their marginal holdingsbluffs when you show strength by raisingcheckraising, so letting them value own themselves and just flatting their bets tends to work better. Slow playing may also make them more hesitant to try to bluffpush you around and get thin value in future hands which also makes them easier to play against.   4 Call Down Lighter  not necessarily saying make crazy hero calls with ace high, but against very aggressive players who value bet thinly and are capable of doubletriple barrel bluffing sometimes you just have to close your eyes and call down with middling hands like top pair good kicker or even sometimes second pair, assuming the runout isnt awful. Even if youre wrong and they happen to have it at the very least it still discourages them from bluffing you in later hands.   5 Bluff Them Occasionally  not saying try to out aggro them or play an even wider range, but because these players play a wider range themselves and are overly aggressive, there will be many pots where they dont have much. Mixing in an occasional flop raisecheckraise or float especially when you have a range advantage and have been playing relatively tight will allow you to steal some pots from these players. In their minds their game plan is often to just keep pushing you around and assume if you fight back you have something. Ideally you will have some backdoor equity when doing this so you can follow up with another big bet on good turns. Cant do this too often otherwise the competent ones will catch on and adjust.   Hope that helps Overly aggro players, especially competent ones can be a nightmare but also a lot of fun to play against and I have found the above strategies to be effective or extremely annoying when employed against me.", "Create a reasonable 3bet range thats wider.

Always labeled as the tight player at the table but i guess its a good thing because as you said people dont want to try and bluff someone who tables a good hand.

It was a lot of fun to play against the guy.", "This is great advice. Keep in mind that there are different flavors of maniac whales. Not all are super aggro ND you need to adjust accordingly.

It makes perfect sense if you think about it for half a second.  If your opponent has AA only, you need to play much tighter than if they are playing any two cards.

One hand a guy called he happened to run into KK and stacked him. Unfortunate but sometimes you run into monsters. Had one hand where i had KK and someone else raised to 12 and i made it 60 in the cutoff with aggro in front of me calling and went heads up to flop of Ad8d3c. Checked around and turn was another diamond and he bet 180 so i folded just knowing i wasnt going all in with 800 effective on a river jam.

Calling allows him to continue the aggression unchecked and it caps your range.", "Being seen as a tight player is actually more reason people will bluff you, because they know they can get you off a hand. It helps make your plays more threatening though, so if you know youve established yourself as a tight player, you can open up your range a little bit.  This is just old school wisdom that most people now probably would disregard, I still havent caught up to the current style of play. I think in person, at the lower stakes tables the old school stuff still works, because youre still dealing with a lot of regular people, rather than poker nerds who know all the ins and outs of GTO play. And Im still confident in my ability to feel out a player.   I forget where I read it, but I think it was Sklansky who compared poker to traffic. You know how when youre driving on the highway sometimes you get a feeling for when someone behind you is about to make a move to pass. And you know when to make your own move. And eventually you almost get a sixth sense for it. You feel like you almost know what the other cars are going to do before they do it. Sitting at a poker table with the same people for a few hours, you can develop a similar sense. You get a feeling for when to make a move, or when other people will make a move. The more I play at a certain table, the more I find myself thinking things like ok this guy is going to bet here, but if I raise him hes going to fold.   So you want to be the person seeing these things, you dont want to be the person who is being seen.  I dont know if any of this applies to the current game, but I know it still works for me.", "Just adopt the same strategy as them. Its basically GTO because if you play the exact same way, you wont lose except to rake, and youre really just there to have a good time.", "If he only plays AA then you have to open 100 of your hands.", "Ok heres an example for you to understand, say youre in the SB and a very tight player is in the BB that folds to every raise except when he has AA, KK or QQ. There are only 18 possible combinations of those hands in a total of 1326 different poker hands, he only ever calls a raise with 181326 hands or 0.013 of hands.  Now by your logic since he is a tight player you should play tighter but if you think about it, you know he will fold 99.9 of the time if you raise, so by raising with 100 of the hands you will steal the BB from him 99.9 of the time, therefore being looser is way more profitable than being tighter. In fact if you play tight you dont even guarantee any money since you might still be behind anyway, you have QQ but the guy plays so tight he might still be ahead with AA or KK.  And if he is looser how youre going to get money from him You play looser yourself that means youre going to miss the flop more often, then you have to ask yourself does this flop hit my opponents range Well he plays all kinds of stuff so yes it does, now you have no idea if you are ahead or behind and its just a gamble.", "You have it half right.  You also have to consider when playing fairly deep against super aggro opponents a lot of your hands are going to have a hard time realizing their equity.   So my suggestion is to buy in shorter and push your equity edges.  Once you get deep then you need to switch to a more polarizes range.  Basically AJ o, KQ, suited aces and kings, suited connectors and pocket pairs.  These are the hands that have an easier time realizing their equity playing deep vs aggro opponents.", "Thats not at all how you exploit loose fish at a 12 table", "This.

Do not check this flop and stop being afraid to get it in. Yes, sometimes he will have A7 or some bullshit but his range from what youve described is laughably wide.

Thats not my logic at all. Were talking about situations where we are facing a bet.  Yes, you are correct in that if the BB is drastically overfolding in the BB to our SB raise, we should be raising 100.  Now lets change it to the scenario to what this thread is actually discussing  What if were in the BB, and the SB is the guy whos only playing QQ.  How often should we be continuing against his open  Are you trying to tell me we should be continuing less often if the opponent is raising blind with any two   And if he is looser how youre going to get money from him You play looser yourself that means youre going to miss the flop more often, then you have to ask yourself does this flop hit my opponents range Well he plays all kinds of stuff so yes it does, now you have no idea if you are ahead or behind and its just a gamble.   Were going to get money from him because hes playing wider range than we are, and it plays it worse postflop than we do.  If you think he has the range advantage on most board because hes playing a wider range, then you fundamentally misunderstand the concept.

He should stop calling marginal hands and start three betting his stronger hands more aggressively.

With these dudes you cant be sweating buyins because you need to realise they will inherently up your variance but instead, you just keep playing solid and loading that stack up if he cracks you with some random junk.  Just to clarify, when I say play solid abc poker you need to look at your preflop three bet range construction. If you cant construct a three bet range against this dude hes gonna run all over you.

The levels are longer, so it decreases variance unless you have the nuts or close to it, in hands where straight and flush draws are less likely.   They have AQ vs AA, so a bigger preflop action, and neither had the nuts at any point. So really there arent many hands she can put him on with the turn, KQs couldve been 3bet pre and youre losing, AA where you want them to stay so the sizing is perfect, KK where youre losing already. Might as well keep it small. The river bet was maybe trying to get a call from KQ or something else weird. Either way its a pretty reasonable fold considering at best shes chopping against anything that would take this line mostly the final bet. A flush sees a pretty obvious boat opportunity. A straight sees the boat and flush. She had what is essentially the weakest boat available. Even 9s full might check back the river   If she had QQ, it most likely would have been 4bet pre.

Hardly nobody 3bet, so trapping with a premium hand made very little sense, and if he did have a premium why not just get it in pre with the maniac Also figured if he had JJ or QQ, he wouldnt shove after I raised preflop, as hed have to be afraid of me.

My main leak I think right now is calling off when lines make very little sense even though its very often just the nuts. I wanted to see what other people thought of this line by villain and if I need to reasses how I construct ranges when facing backraises and other weird preflop lines. Seems like the answer is yes.", "I think 3bet preflop is correct because Im definitely ahead of Maniac and hell always shove with way worse, so folding the LJ is good for me. I think once LJ jams its time to let go.", "He doesnt raise the maniac because hes a 12 player and thinks hes being smart by merely calling to make sure theres no ace on the flop. He doesnt want to get blown off KK or whatever. But when original raiser jams over a 3bet, he doesnt have that worry. He can get it in and realize 100 of his equity so he happily rejams his kings or queens or whatever. I think AA is less likely here, but Ive seen backraises like this being AA too, but that makes far less sense.", "When playing live I think its important to make things simple too, LJ probably just didnt have a read or isnt thinking about it. TT is looking to make a set or see a low disconnected flop in a 300bb pot for the best chance of putting money in your pocket. You saw a chance to get it in pre out of position against a maniac which is great, and if you were short thatd be a fine all in too because lower SPR, but TT is not the hand to get wild with.   Calling also would have been totally fine, tens is a great disguised monster and is actually at the boundary of the 3bet value and calling ranges and sometimes you just have no fold equity.  Folding good hands in the right spots saves you so much money its unbelievable sometimes, its the only reason why people can bluff. We love hero calls, but we also dont focus on the monstrous value people earn by getting hero called. Try not to get discouraged, Id say most peoples big leak is calling off too often.", "I definitely agree the 3 bet is good if you were heads up with the maniac. But with both players in if maniac just called your raise, the LJ is priced in and then youre going 3 ways to a flop with a pair of tens oop. And youre also dealing with the possibility of what just happened and youre forced to fold.", "Yeah youre right.  The main takeaway is that you shouldnt ever give your opponents too much credit for thinking about the game the same way you or I do.", "Yeah this is all correct in retrospect. Honestly I think everyone made a mistake in that hand. Maniac obviously shouldnt shove into 3bets with his whole range, LJ shouldnt have flatted as most times he is making the minimum, and I made a bad call.  Im just the one that got punished the hardest lol. But I do agree that if Im only 3betting for value against a maniac, my 5bet jam calling range doesnt need to be that wide.  Im pretty good about folding post flop to aggression, so i need to take that discipline with me preflop. I will try working harder on my preflop play next year.

This is a misconception though that 20buyins automatically means 5 risk of ruin.   PREVIOUS REPLY COPYPASTED   So the thing about these buyinmetric bankrolls is that people will say 30 buyins as a standard to get risk of ruin down to 5, but the reality is that this bankroll standard is calculated on an assumed 5bbhr winrate at live cash games.  Which means, that you actually need to have a true winrate of 5bbhr for this bankroll standard to really mean anything to you if 5 risk of ruin is the goal.  If your winrate is any lower than 5bbhr, then mathematically you would need much much more than 30 buyins to keep that RoR down to handle variance.  The sample sizes achieved in a live format are so tiny in comparison to what is needed for statistically significant conclusions that you will likely never really know your true winrate. Which means that live cash game bankroll management becomes more of an educatedguessing game than a science.  IMHO better advice is to just play within your means. If you have a steady income and 2k is easily recoverable and youre comfortable with the risk, then maybe fire a bullet or two at 25 to see where you stand.

I only have a general read on NL2 players and that they dont bluff the river often. I think Villains range on the River is very limited on Pocket Pairs between 6699 maybe because with other hands he wouldnt have called 2 cbets after open limping and calling my bet preflop.  This means I have 46 Equity on the River against his range and a call is EV. But this suggests that he is capable of going all in w 88. I doubt he does that very often so I guess my fold is correct, what do you think", "This is 2NL. A river shove is basically never a bluff, so I wouldnt call here with much less than the nuts.", "Other than 6699, couldnt Villain have a suited ace of spades or hearts", "2NL  no bluffs outside of drunk maniacs", "There are some possible bluffs 8887sJTsnonnut flush draws97s.  Full houses and straights would likely have raised flop or turn. Trips like 86s65s should often raise turn because the river will be so ugly a lot of the time and theyll lose value by not getting it in on the turn.  So when he gets to river, you mainly have to worry about him having chased with the nut flush draw and pairing the ace.  This is where Th is actually good to have, and the standard flush blocker logic works in reverse. You want to have the heart because you will block AhTh making it a little less likely he hit the ace. With the gutshot straight flush draw  overcard he actually is correctly calling. He almost has the direct odds to call vs. all overpairs except AA, and is making the easily correct call if you are ever bluffing.  Whereas KhKx is not as good because its less likely he limped with AhKh or AhQh than AhTh.  If he has A2A3A4A5A8A9AT of hearts as his realistic aces, having Th reduces the chance he has an ace by 14 more if he folds everything but A8A9ATA5 which have straight draws and T8s by 50. Blocking T8s is relevant because that hand should feel safe slowplaying. Even if the board double pairs its unlikely you have a full house, the board is less likely to 4 straight, so its not urgent to GII on turn. Id call even at 2NL but probably would at 50NL and higher.  It also depends on what you do when you have Ah or As hands. If you check a lot of your Ax you dont need to call with worse than an ace and can fold all TT. But I dont think you can check too much Ax, youll need to shove a lot with your aces, to protect when youre bluffing with JTs or 88, missed hearts, KQ of spades etc.", "I mean he could have, some percentage of the time he will arrive on the River with Ax.

I dont think cbet frequency is the worst for that, but it still takes a while to build up. I guess worse would be like river stats, because the river is not reached as much as preflop bets, say.  But anyway, my point is you ideally should use multiple stats to determine what type of player someone is e.g. nit, loose. One thing that helps with this I find is you can set certain ranges of stats to show as different colours on PT4, HoldEm Manager, etc. So you could set VPIP 020 as red, say. If you do this right for multiple stats, you can tell the player type by the overall colour.  Another minor thing is that the most useful stats are the ones that happen the most often, because they are accurate more quickly with a smaller sample size, like VPIP and PFR.  I know youre not necessarily looking for tips, but just for the sake of discussion on the internet.  Edit like the problem with blindly exploiting the player pool is that if a certain player is playing in an opposite manner, they will be majorly exploiting you. The question is does this happen rarely enough that the exploits on the player pool are still worth it Thats why some rough identification of wildly offoptimal player types with a HUD is useful imo. Like if someone has 60 VPIP theyre unlikely to be a nit, which means if youre trying to exploit them you should treat them oppositely to a nit.", "I dont think HUDs are very useful for individual call or fold decisions. The players tendencies shown by the HUD are drowned out by all of the other more important factors affecting his range in a specific spot.

You definitely cant memorise the full game tree as well, so youll have to create heuristics for the turn and river as well.

I learned every single opening hand from every position. Dont deviate from the ranges until you have them memorized. Cbet about 75 of the time. That means cbet if you hit the flop or have any draws. If you dont hit the flop and dont have any draws, dont cbet. Also dont cbet a lot in multi way pots. Only checkraise for value. Cbet 50 of the pot with medium pair or draw. Cbet 75 or 100 of the pot with top pair or better. If you hit a monster, you can slowplay. Respect 3bets a lot. Fold anything but your best hands. You can 4bet AQ, JJ.

The problem I encountered with bluffing is that many bad players will call me down with bottom pair.

Hes bluffing every pot he gets into and frequently making ridiculous over bets.    I get into a big pot with the guy and the run out is 784J5, weve got queens. He jams all in on the river for about 3 times the pot. Against anyone else this is a clear fold but against this guy something doesnt quite add up. I tank for about a minute all the while the guy is telling me how badly he wants me to call trying to convince me to fold but doing the opposite. So I reluctantly put my chips in and he confidently shouts straight and throws down 23 offsuit. I stupidly believe him thinking he has the low straight and  throw my cards face down to muck them not into the muck but over the line.  So, I get up and go to buy more chips and the manager comes over and explains to me that the guy had nothing but since I mucked my hand he still scooped the pot.   I should also mention this was the second time hed claimed to have a straight whilst tabling only 4 cards to the straight.  By the time Id gotten back to the table hed already given most of my chips back to the pros at the table. I asked him if he did it on purpose to make me muck the winning hand and he just laughed at me obnoxiously.  So my questione are  Did the guy cheat or is it okay to lie about your hand at showdown to induce someone to muck the winning hand  Did the floor handle it well and should I try to follow up on the incident Im not happy with how the floor handled it and feel like the pot probably shouldnt have been shipped his way after tabling the nut low and announcing straight. My cards were still retrievable and Id clearly just been angled out of a huge pot but the casino holds a strong once your cards are mucked, theyre dead policy.  Should I just suck it up and accept accountability Im still really upset with the whole situation and angry at myself for being so stupid but I also dont feel like going back to this casino. I probably should because I have been going there everyday and usually winning there but this loss was huge and has taken a huge chunk out of my winnings. Should I just get over it and continue grinding there as it does seem to be profitable  TLDR  Guy bluffs all in with complete air, I call and he shouts straight causing me to muck the winning hand.

If all else fails and you cant interpret boards very well just show your hand at showdown", "Never take someones word like that. Ive seen people say Chinese straight as a joke and show a 4 card straight and the person just muck. They felt really bad for it because it was a clear joke. Its your job to also read the hand or not muck before the dealer pushes up the straight.

In this scenario, you mucked faced down and walked away without saying anything or challenging the hands. Once the dealer scoops it up, youre pretty well screwed.  BUT what isnt strictly true is mucked hands are dead. If you muck, even face down, and the cards are recoverable then they arent dead just because you threw them away. So even more unfortunately, if you had immediately realized your mistake and wanted to take your hand back, that should have been allowed by the floor. Im sure this scumbag would have argued, and you can never rely on the floor to actually know the rules, but unless this card room has a set of special rules on a plaque somewhere saying all mucked hands are automatically dead, any recoverable hand is still in play. This even includes hands that have touched the muck as long as the dealer or camera room can clearly identify your cards. Again, enforcement is going to be all over the place, especially with some angle shooter screaming at the floorman that you threw your cards away.  But anyway, lesson learned.

The player who saw my hand also happened to be a friend of the Villain. The villain, without hesitation, gives me half the pot.  I agree my hand was dead and he didnt have to give anything.

I had aces and the guy shoves on me.  I was really nervous the guy had a queen but I called because it was really late in the tourny and the blinds were going to eat me in a few rotations.  anyway the guy immediately says Ive got queens full of sevens so Im like ah shit and I put my cards face up and walked away from the table.  A guy ran after me and said that villain actually had 2 pairs, queens and sevens.  So i go back and the tourny guy said since I mucked my hand and walked away and the next hand was dealt I was beat.  The guy was 100 percent cheating.  The tourny directordealer should have caught it and didnt but I figure it was ultimately on me and I should always verify that a hand is authentic when there is that much at stake.  Still chaps my ass though.  Ive learned that this is a really common move for cheaters.  Later on Ive seen two different people get ejected from home games for doing this.  They were warned the first time then asked to leave the second time.  It seems like they like to do it on straights, i guess bc its easier to say you just misread your hand and also the chances of someone misreading it are higher.", "Ouch. I think most of the responses are right. He didnt cheat. He tabled his hand. More of an angle than anything else.   One thing you should be doing in a hand is identifying exactly which combos make straights before your call. I mean, this is important info affecting your decision anyway. Once you do that it takes just a second to look at his hand and see he has one of them or doesnt. I used to mess this up sometimes. Id miss a possible straight combo and have to sit there like a noob for a bit figuring out how he has a straight with his 2 cards. Anyway, take the time to do that and this wont ever happen again.", "Dont muck ever to a player like that, you give nothing away to others as playing against a loud call box losing player is not about your standard game play", "Man, I really dont get how people fail to read the board carefully in big pots.

These guys are all trying to eat your food and fuck your girlfriend  never forget that.", "Cheated isnt the right word  the pot was awarded to the best tabled hand at showdown.  You definitely got angled, though.  The fact that you already caught him doing it once should probably tip you off that you need to pay attention to his antics.

How were you able to stand up, go get more chips, and have a conversation with the floor, all while your cards were still retrievable  If its an instance where he says straight and  you toss your cards facedown in front of you, and then you realize you actually had the winning hand, your hand is still live in most rooms, as long as its clearly identifiable.  The way you wrote the story though, it seems like you didnt realize he didnt have it until the floor came up to you and told you.   The floor handled it fairly well, imo, by informing you that you were playing with an angler so hopefully you would be more diligent in the future.  Some people would prefer to not know they made a big blunder like this, but overall I think he made the right move to inform you that you were playing with an angler so you can be more diligent in the future.  Some might prefer to kick a guy like this out, and Im not opposed to that, but keep in mind that these type of guys are almost always punters, so theres a lot of regs who would get angry if he was given the boot.  Its the old cant please everyone scenario.  At the end of the day, yes, you should suck it up and take accountability.  This instance was clearly intentional, but keep in mind that people actually misread their hand at times also.

I slid my cards face down across the betting line and pushed my chips forward. However, the dealer never grabbed my cards and moved them into the muck they just sat in front of me facedown. As the dealer counted my stack, I realized he didnt have a straight. I grabbed my cards and tabled them. The player with A3 obviously freaked out, and the floor was called.

On the flop, he is once again getting a very good price and you are quite deep, meaning he might be floating pretty wide. As such AK will mostly be the best hand on the flop. The turn bet is fine, and the raise is actually really small in relation to the pot. What this means is that he has the potential to do this quite light with some of his flop floats that turned equity, trip aces worse than AK, possibly a hand like 99 for protection, as well as some boats.

Effective stack around 100 bb There is a limp in mid position, and then the Button raises to 4 bb over the limp. I pick up pocket 8s in the big blind. I elect to 3 bet to 16, as both the limper and the button are playing way too wide, and Id like to get the pot right there, or be heads up with the button with most likely a better hand preflop. Flop comes pretty ideal 4 4 5 rainbow. I elect to go a bit over 23 pot, and the button calls.   Since he is a pretty big station, I think hes probably calling any ace strong kicker here, maybe ace middling kicker as well, could even be calling king Broadway but Im not sure, and hes obviously calling any pairs he has, and probably any draw.  Turn hits a 3, and adds a flush draw, and only having a bit over 23 pot left, I elect to jam, hoping he gets really sticky with his A10AK, his flush draws, or pocket pairs worse than mine... But he calls and he hit the straight on the turn with 76 suited. I know i cant control getting sucked out on, and virtually anyway I played this post flop I was probably getting stacked, but was a check the right move on the turn hoping to induce a bluff with his floats, since a good portion of what calls me on the turn has me beat I cant decide whether a protection bet, or checking and hoping he bluffs or that the river bricks is the better play.  Thanks for any input.", "With less than a pot sized bet left I think there is no helping getting it in on the turn. If you think that villain is aggressive and might blast off you can check to him. You also could be up against JJ  99", "Flop is more of a 13 range bet spot. This would leave you room for a bigger size on the turn when a good card comes, which the 3 isnt and allow for some river play. You can check 8s on the turn sometimes, but he is going to be folding a ton of overcards to the second bet, so after a 13 range bet I like a 23 size on the turn leaving you a half pot jam for a river brick. Youre going to win this pot so often with this line that these coolers are almost irrelevant. The suits of your cards versus the board are also a factor here particularly to decide your frequency on the turn. And obviously what to do on the river", "I think theres a bit of a contradiciton in what range youre putting your opponents on. You say you 3b the 8s because theres a limper and the BTN is opening way too wide, then further down you only mention folding out his AK, A10, and maybe some other Ax suited or Suited broadway combos. But if youve noticed he is opening wide and especially because hes on the button, then 76s is a very reasonable combo he could have.   The flop sizing might be be slightly big, as he could still have some over pairs and some a5 combos, plus straight draws as we find out and you dont quite have the nut advantage on this board althought you do likely have the range advantage. This also means you have bigger bets on Turn and river so you have more playability on the later streets and will have 2 half pot sized bets left should you want to get it in.   All things said, mostly just a cooler, but there are some things you can take away from it.", "Yeah, I figured I could be up against 99 through maybe even queens, but thought he probably had more combinations I beat that call, then he had over pairs and other hands that beat me. I really didnt want to let the turn check through and see a face card hit, but it does kind of seem like one of those spots where you check to the aggressive player, and shove against the more passive calling station.", "I was pretty sure GTO wise its usually 13 pot on the flop there, but since the villain was a station, I thought I could get called by a lot worse with 23, and have a bet more protection against weaker Broadways, but maybe that was a mistake.", "I was mentioning him calling wide with AKA10 to the flop and turn bets, not folding it out. While he is wide, and him having the 76 makes sense, it doesnt mean he will never have AKA10, I only mentioned it because I was targeting callsor folding out equity from those hands, as he is obviously folding out complete misses in his wide range like j9 suited or qj off.  You have a point that I didnt mention he would be calling flop with pretty much any draw like 76 suited so Ill add that to the post.  Looking back, 76 suited does make sense with his range, but I guess I would be lying if I said I was thinking it was a big possiblity. That being said, since he would likely be calling the 3 bet with A10AQ offsuit and suited likely 4 bet with Ak and only calling 76 suited, hes going to have way more combos of A10Q.  As for the smaller sizing on the flop, I think you may be right that it was a bit big.", "Sometimes youll run into it but generally you will be ok with getting it in on the turn.

You cant bluff at only the optimal frequencies preflop because position matters so much. So your bluff range on the button is going to be much wider than your bluff range UTG, despite opening the same or similar sizes. The solver just determines which hands are EV to open and that forms your base RFI range.  And this is what solvers do post flop too. They dont always keep precisely to what the math says are optimal fold frequencies, bluff frequencies etc. EV is much more important.", "the pure bluff to value ratio you are talking about only applies to river when a polarized range of bluffs that cannot improve no future streets that loses to all bluffcatchers is bet alongside hands that beat all bluff catchers  this becomes less and less distinguishable as you move backwards into earlier streets until preflop where the range becomes merged such that there are no bluff vs value ratio because having 3 cards flop changes your range too drastically to identify a polarized bluff vs value ratio  this is why preflop strategy opens our best hands that are ev, instead of opening a range consisting of AA with 72o    your best preflop hands will become terrible on some boards and the bottom 0ev opens will become good playable hands enough of the time such that you dont need to polarize preflop at all", "Its fluid.

Lots of straddles, making the pots pretty good sized and players were calling with all sorts of wild stuff.  Started off with 200 and was sitting with around 400 in front of me and was considering ending the session, had been playing for 3 hours and felt I was playing solid throughout the night.  Im dealt aces, spade and diamond, in middle position and button has thrown a 4 straddle on. The button is a very loose and wild player that  bluffs a lot and has a tendency to reraise whenever he straddles. Folds around but one player to my right calls the straddle and I decide to just straddle hoping for the button to reraise. Folds to button and he reraises to 15, other caller folds and I reraise to 50.....he decides to call.  Before the flop comes out he announces that he will check in the dark. Button has a VERY deep stack for the table, not entirely sure but at least 600700.  Flop comes 2QK on a rainbow board. Already Im confident he doesnt have a set on any of those, pocket 2s are extremely unlikely and based upon what I had seen earlier he would have reraised if he was holding pocket kings of queens.  I decide to downbet to 35 to see where he is at, as he calls with such a large range of hands. He then reraises me to 100 and I take my time with it making a decision. He normally looks very confident when he had made moves, but I could see that he was uncomfortable with where he was at by looking at his body language breathing, etc.. As mentioned earlier, I didnt put him on anything like a set of king or queens and a broadway draw holding an ace was very unlikely with me holding 2 of them. Kingqueen for 2 pair was the only thing I was worried about but given his play earlier I didnt think this was the case and was putting him on KJ or K10 suited.  I then announce that Im all in, so about another 250 for him to call,  He sighs out loud and starts asking me if I have ace king and that he has ace king, basically trying to get a response out of me. He then says f it and then says that he calls and he turns over K9 of hearts and I turn over my aces.

Where do the numbers come from and how many buyins do we actually need Does mixing stakes matter and do we take the average buyin when calculating this Ill attempt to answer all of this here.  The two biggest factors in determining how many buyins you need is  x200B  1. Field size  Put simply, the more people there are in a tournament, the higher variance and more buyins youll need. Your bankroll needed in small tournament with an average field size of 100 players is significantly different from a bankroll requirement in a 1000 person field. The site shown here is primedope.com, which is an excellent resource and also in no way am I affiliated with them, it is simple just a resource that I use a lot, and I strongly suggest you plug in a bunch of numbers to visualize your own situation.  x200B  100Man MTThttpspreview.redd.itguh2yu2e8x2a1.pngwidth909formatpngautowebps75e6754d57fde475c308987aaa750f60117f7866  500Man MTThttpspreview.redd.iti448ltxh8x2a1.pngwidth1552formatpngautowebps5d36e4db09b01167498606e7cea1238c83264210  As you can see, the bankroll requirements between a 100man MTT and a 500man are very different.  130 buyins for a 1 RoR risk of ruin vs  420 buyins, respectively.  x200B  2. Estimated total ROI  This one also feels pretty self explanatory. The higher your ROI, the less buyins you need. However, its easy to overestimate your ROI, as most people usually think that they are better than their actual ability, so I would probably subtract 510 from your perceived ROI to be safe when doing the calculations. As you can see from the picture below, having 15 more ROI in the 55s with an average field size of 500 lowers your bankroll requirement by 180 buyins  x200B  3537 ROI in a 55 500manhttpspreview.redd.itbolsd0ik8x2a1.pngwidth1824formatpngautowebpsd44c2e5c5b27fee2b78880719ef600dfa0dfcd3e  x200B  Other common misconceptions  x200B   Satellites are a really big one. We often hear people say If you dont have the bankroll to play the original event, you shouldnt play in the satellite. This couldnt be further from the truth. Your bankroll requirements are actually significantly reduced when sattying into an event.  In the following example, we are gonna try to salty into the 55 500man MTT.  The numbers I put in for the satty is a tournament that would give 10 55 tickets.  With a 20 ROI, you will satellite in about once every 4 games in this example.  Your bankroll requirement is effectively halved  55 500man with 11 Satelliteshttpspreview.redd.itvpduor4m8x2a1.pngwidth1848formatpngautowebps5ecd9fe8c6b8b36dc101f29f21d0f188fe01fce7  x200B  x200B   If you are mixing buyins, you also dont need as big of a bankroll.

If you check your stats in sharkscope and lets say you have 10k sample 20 Abi 20 roi 1k AVG runners, then you plug those numbers in  the variance it calculates is way underestimated. Primedope lets you plug in multiple tournament types so if you set it up to run 10 different tournaments each with different buyins, roi, runners etc but the AVG runnersbuyinroi and the sample size is the same as the earlier example, the resulting variance is a lot higher in the second sim. In reality an mtt regs schedule will have a bunch more different tournaments than this so primedope will always underestimate their variance.    My other issue with primedope is that I think the risk of ruin and thus bankroll needed numbers it calculates are basically useless. If you have a decent mtt bankroll and you dust half of it off, you dont keep playing the same schedule...

What you do with your winning matters.  These calculations assume all winnings stay in the bankroll.  So for example, if the calculations say you need 500 BI for 1 risk of ruin, that doesnt mean  you have a 1 chance of a 500 BI downswing.  It means that when the 500 BI downswing does come youll have a 99 chance of having won enough to absorb it. 2. Where you started doesnt matter.  So if your risk tolerance is max 1 risk of ruin, and you need 500 BI for that, once you have 499 BI you would need to stop playing.  So this means you would need much more than 500 BI to avoid getting to an unacceptable risk of ruin.  One final thing.  If you have 2 buyin technically your risk of ruin for that tournament is zero.  100 chance you will not be ruined when the tournament is complete.

Agree with your second point, you def gotta adjust if you half your roll was dusted you would need to change what games you would play.

In practice if you have a significant edge over the field then youre still going to have chances to double up quickly after late registering and if you dont have an edge then playing a shorter stack limits their ability to outplay you.

I was the outsider as I hadnt gone there recently and when I do go I play cash.   A couple weird hands happened and I noticed a guy to my right saying chicken instead of check and they would immediately check down. I thought that was odd but maybe guy was just odd.  Then a hand happens where a reg, who I could tell was competent, flops top pair in a SRP with AQo against another guy, they check all the way through and the other guy has AT. Were all 60bb ish deep at this point. Meanwhile My opens are getting 3bet, and c bets are being check raised.   So when the hands were tabled I called them out and said that half the table is soft playing and its total bullshit in a normal tourney to do that let alone in one where theres significant last in side action. The players didnt even deny it. The one reg apologized said I was right and we kept going. I couldve pulled out but I wanted to play and it was only a 120 buy in. Despite this I was chip leading at the first break because I hit quads twice and got paid.   In break I go to the bathroom and the weird ass dealer corners me and says how I better not forget his tip and like damn I need to close this out hell make it happen if he has to. I assume he was kidding about the make it happen part but maybe if I pursued taking him up on that he wouldve done it who knows was fucking weird and I got out of there  Fast forward I bubble the last in losing QQ to 53s all in pre to some Asian guy who showed up late shit talking the whole table. Whatever.    I go to the floor the woman who runs it after I bust and tell her what happened. I say who was involved and how its a bummer because I liked playing here but probably wouldnt again now. I wasnt asking for my buy in back or anything like that I was just making her aware her response to this was  I know how they play and its a problem  Its because theres a 1,000 for First and Its one table. You should play the bigger events, they wont be able to do that.   Other than that she was polite and heard me out, but those two quotes stuck with me and showed how not serious they take cheatingcollusion.   So then I started going down the rabbit hole thinking of my cash game hands, hands where an OMC would check raise my cbet big , another guy would  cold call, Id fold and they would check down. Or old men who showed no aggression would take these weird aggressive actions that somehow led to check downs when that really shouldnt be happening at too high of a frequency. Previously, I figured I was being paranoid. After the incident I couldnt be so sure.   Thats my experience, I made money in my 100hrs or so playing cash at RCG, but I still wont go back there.   Also what stuck with me is if the floor knew about the collusion being an issue, what dont they know about.. Then a couple months later we hear about the cards up the sleeves.   To each their own but I would advise against going there. CCG seems to be more above board, but whos to say.

Casinos are exponentially safer than those charity games that only exist by bending around the rules.

There is definitely a different feel to these charity games than your normal casino. The player pool is smaller so most of the regs tend to know each other. Soft playing can definitely be a thing although its not as rampant as others are making it out to be. But it does happen.  Just a couple of weeks ago I was in a game and every time me and this older player who is also a tournament dealer were involved in 3 bet pot he would wink at me and ask me if there was enough in the pot already After the third time of him asking me this I told him I was there to play poker and not interested in checking it down. That seemed to put a stop to that.  It is true a player got caught cheating and rightfully banned a few months back. This finally made them realize having players shuffling cards on the button was probably a dumb idea. Other than that Ive never really felt unsafe in this room but its always a good idea to be watchful and point out anything that doesnt seem right.

Ive literally played mixed games where there were 40 allowed variants and the only rule was no wild cards. They end up changing the values of hands too much so that they skew towards the nuts all the time, the games end up being ones where either very little action happens because no one has the nuts and no one feels like bluffing in a game where its too easy to have a hidden monster or a player ends up not understanding the true value of the wild cards in play and losing their whole stack in one hand and quitting poker all together because they felt tricked by the stupid game with jokers I dont specifically mean DJP here, just jokers in general.  For new players who like to talk about making quads and royal flushes but winning tiny pots this will entertain briefly, but actual poker players will have no interest in your game.  Also, your even entertaining producing paper cards for poker is laughable, poker played with paper cards means the cards will be worthless in just a few hands as they mark too easily, as a cheap collectors item maybe, but there is no value to producing paper cards for poker. There is a reason why literally every poker game played for even modest amounts of money uses plastic cards.  Lastly, while your game is unique somewhat it isnt anything that I cant literally do with the cards I already have. The decks I purchase contain 3 jokers and have two different colored backs, to achieve the same game I only have to include jokers from the red deck in the blue deck or vice versa and if I want the Orange or Black joker to have some significance I can easily mark the face with sharpie or the back if I need the back to stick out for a specific joker.  This variant isnt something I even need to make a new purchase to try.

Regarding your comment about skill elements and nuts peddling when using wild cards in poker. I agree with you, and thats why I say that with DJP you need to use your skills to play the players more than you can use your skills to play the odds, because thats just a fact. Playing poker DJPstyle relying only on the odds could get you more easily blindsided.   Ive played poker both online and offline, and I guess DJP is better suited for offline play because it changes the dynamic of the game. Playing it online while not being able to see the players reactions and such I would guess is very difficult, maybe even frustrating and not even that enjoyable.   I guess long story short, same as with all games, it depends on what you like about a game that makes it if you like playing it or not.

However, the psychological effect, even from the hidden Jokers that I think youre not seeing is the effect that simply getting the Jokers in your hands, or on the communal cards have on people.

Im not bluffing a lot, and consistently overfolding, as it doesnt seem like the population on Ignition is bluffing much either. Im finding it easy to get a lot of value from one pair holdings that refuse to fold. Ive recognized some consistent spots where I can bluff 50NL players seem absolutely terrified when the board allows for a flush, but generally overfold to aggression and rely on my opponents overplaying their hands.

If we win AK vs AQ, thats just whats supposed to happen right But AK is only a 70 favorite, its supposed to lose a lot. Yet, the language is pretty extreme to describe this. AK dominates AQ, overpair dominates underpair, nut flush draw dominates other flush draws. This hand crushes that hand.  Except, all those hands have 2030 equity. Thats a lot actually. If youre losing almost a third of the time, it wouldnt feel that bad if the proper expectation is set. Yet, its called a bad beat. These are overexaggerations that we are innoculated in for years, especially when were just starting out and are latching onto new info.  Another thing is, it really feels good to suckout, because it happens pretty rarely that good players get it in drawing thinner than 20. Part of being a better player is getting sucked out on more than the reverse.  So getting lucky is exceptionally rare. You have to get it in bad, and then on top of that you actually hit your hand. So that joy of actually stealing something youre not entitled to, is rarer.  I recommend understanding bad beats and coolers differently. I dont consider it a bad beat unless I get oneoutered, maybe twooutered, with one card to come. I dont feel unlucky or bad unless I lose like eight of nine 7030s in a row or something. Because in every other case the other guy had a ton of equity. To lose as a decent favorite and call it a bad beat is not only unproductive but inaccurate.  Then theres quality of play. I dont know a huge amount about the game, but we can only try and study more. So if I make a call and ran into the stone nuts I ask myself Do I beat any value  can he ever bluff even 10 of the time That will usually get me to the 2533 equity I need in most scenarios to justify a call and be ok with my decision.

Perhaps the instantaneous occurrence is bad however if you look at the past three years of never having this happen one might say its tremendously fortunate this is the only time it has happened.   What this means to point out is we are subject to the situations we put ourselves in and the framing we provide them.   If you regularly find yourself down badly due to losses it could be that you are playing poorly in which you need to work on your situational performance. It could also be related to your framing in which you are more thankful and observant of the times where your good hands have held.

RobbiRip were being signaled by someone in the poker room on whether they should check, call, bet or fold they were not being signaled if they are ahead or behind like commonly thought. We know this because Robbi is often unsure if she is good or not at showdown she also misreads her hand, can only produce word salad explanations for her play and does not know if she is value betting or bluffing at times.  RobbiRip do not cheat in stream 1 on 921 lower stakes. They do cheat in stream 2 on 923 higher stakes and stream 3 on 929 higher stakes. There is a huge difference in their play in stream 1 vs streams 23 most notably not looking into the poker room in a manner that could be cheating in stream 1 and looking all the time in streams 23.  RobbiRip play like casual poker players in stream 1. Rip splashes around a lot calls 3bets4bets pre with trash and Robbi is weakpassive. In streams 23, they play wayyyy better and close to perfect at times, though with some mistakes reason for mistakes explained below.  Robbi looks into the poker room occasionally in the first 1 hour and 45 minutes she is on stream 1 but NONE of those looks could plausibly be cheating in my opinion. Robbi is often looking preflop which would not help much with cheating and seems more natural as she is not invested in the hand yet. Robbi rarely looks in later streets which would be critical for cheating. Other reasons these looks could not be cheating is that sometimes Robbi is actually looking at RipNik Airball, sometimes Robbi looks after she has acted on one street and before the next street is dealt and sometimes Robbi looks and then gets bluffed or bets vs air when she should checkcall if she were cheating.  Robbi looks into poker room almost every hand I saw her play in streams 23 when the water bottle was on the table usually out of the side of her eye, sometimes even squinting or staring and very often multiple times per hand, if not every street. Rip turns around in his seat and looks into the poker room as well in the middle of hands when either he or Robbi still have cards. RobbiRip often do this in critical situations in the largest pots and have a very high success rate.  RobbiRip stall often in streams 23 which is a very noticeable deviation from their play in stream 1 when we know they are not cheating. Whatever signaling method that was being used was clearly not always available and therefore RobbiRip do still make the occasional mistake, mostly in smaller pots I think. When the pots got the biggest, I imagine RobbiRip did enough stalling that they would get the signal in those situations at least most of the time.  x200B  These next two points are not as certain, but still very probable  RobbiRip are only cheating in streams 23 when the water bottle is on the table. The water bottle specifically placing the bottle on the table or removing the bottle from the table was probably used as a way for RobbiRip to send a signal to Bryan who has no phone in the control room and possibly no laptopinternet without leaving the table. It is not clear what this signal would be for my guess is to let Bryan know that it is safe to cheat, or it is not safe. Rip seems to take off his hat as a signalreminder to Robbi to change the position of the water bottle when Robbi does not notice right away that she needs to do this. Rip may also take off his hat to signal Bryan when Robbi has left the table and a signal still needs to be sent to Bryan.  The reason why Robbi calls the allin with Jc4h is very likely because the 4h and 6c were replaced about 1520 minutes before the infamous hand went down and the person signaling Robbi thought that Robbi had JcXc vs Garretts 8c7c on a ThTc9c3h board. This is very likely the case because RobbiRip are cheating in every hand they play in streams 23 when the water bottle is on the table, yet the only hand that seemed suspicious in real time was the J4 hand. So there must be something special about this hand, and what stands out the most about this hand is Robbi getting dealt the 4h that just got replaced.  x200B   These last few points are definitely speculative. We are still working out all the details, but there is really no doubt that RobbiRipBryanUnknown 4th5th person cheated  I do NOT think that Bryan was relaying hole card information by looking at the graphics in the control room this was a red herring. Instead, I think Bryan used his insider access to set up a separate system that would automatically send real time hole card info to the person in the poker room signaling RobbiRip Matt Berkey discussing the vulnerability of the Hustler Casino Live server which hosts the RFID data on the Solve For Why podcast httpswww.youtube.comwatchvFMU3Ul9DNQMt5180shttpswww.youtube.comwatchvFMU3Ul9DNQMt5180s. This allowed the person in the poker room to be solely responsible for signaling RobbiRip what to do in the hands they played without any additional input from Bryan. Doing so may have been necessary because Bryan was busy working relaying to RobbiRip exactly how to play their hands requires too much attentionfocus, it would be difficult Bryan has no phone in the control room and possibly no laptopinternet and to avoid suspicion it could be suspicious if other people are in the control room and Bryan is supposed to be working but instead, he is constantly messaging the person in the poker room.  I strongly suspect that setting up this separate system to automatically send real time hole card info to the person in the poker room required Bryan to createmaintain a separate database of RFID numbers matched to suitrank. This is because something like a separate database would be needed for the card swap theory 4h6c mixup to be true and this is the only plausible theory we have.  The RFID numbers for the 4h and 6c were labeled correctly by the stream so the graphics are never wrong but Bryan messed up the labeling in the separate database that the person in the poker room was using and somehow labeled the RFID number for the 4h as a club. This is what caused the signaler in the poker room to think that Robbi had JcXc in the J4 hand.  RobbiRip are not cheating in stream 1 and Robbi is not cheating in the beginning of stream 2 the water bottle does not appear on the table until 31057. Bryan said in a 22 post that he did not work on the day of stream 1 and was late for work on the day of stream 2 httpsforumserver.twoplustwo.comshowpost.phpp57852804postcount1107httpsforumserver.twoplustwo.comshowpost.phpp57852804postcount1107. So I believe Bryan needed to be in the control room in order for the cheating to occur.  The most likely suspects for the other members of the cheating group are Darren Attebery Beanz and Luis the floorman. I do NOT think that Nik Airball was involved in the cheating.

Check check.  x200B  River 35.5bb is 3d.  Villain bets 20bb.  x200B  Is this a call or a fold  I was really stuck on this one and ended up calling losing to T9 hearts.  I think this would have been an easier decision if I had more info on villain but this was their first hand in the game.  Ive noticed a lot of online players like to check raise their flush draws so because it went check call, I reduced this chance in my mind obviously I know its still a possibility.  Brutal turn card but when they checked I was happy to check it back in my mind the biggest likelihood was that they were floating with 2 overs on the flop, otherwise they were check calling with a flush draw, or maybe had A8, and were very rarely slowplaying TT.  So when villain checked turn rather than betting which it seems like the majority of their flop checkcall check range might want to do, I assigned a much higher likelihood to hands like 98s87s, or KT.  In retrospect perhaps I ought to have continued small and be done with the hand should they call or raise.  The big river bet also really confused me.  It seemed extremely bluffy what were they expecting me to be betting flop and checking back turn with that could call such a big bet and players also tend to bluff more on their first hand in.  But maybe they knew all these things so decided to make their bet look a bluff.  Im not sure.  x200B  In any event, is the river a call or fold for hero  Again, I suspect betting the turn for info might be a decent idea, but once the river comes whats the play", "Why does river look bluffy Thats not a particularly large river bet, it is sized appropriately for most flushes that want to check turn OOP without donking. They can also be some 2 pair hands or 56s which is double gutted on the flop and got there. As played river is a pretty clear fold unless you have information that villain is firing too often when you check even then you have so many better hands to bluff catch like Ax or other pairs with a heart to call with or turns hands like 78 into a bluff.", "There arent really missed draws. Its hard to imagine a worse hand betting for value. Maybe they called flop with KhQd, and decided to bluff. Maybe theyre betting 98s for reasons they dont entirely understand. But thats about all we could hope for. And if KQ or 98 are reasonable hands for them to show up with, AQ or JJ are too. 2.81 means we need to be good here over 25 of the time just to break even. I just dont see it.", "What do you beat Random Kx or Qx that floats the flop... and doesnt connect with the frontdoor heart draw or straight draw  In order for the call to be profitable, villain would have to be willing to float with complete air, then bluff the river.  Go back to preflop Hes the initial raiser. He also has tons of Ax in his range, which can go for thinvalue on the river as well.   Villains turn check means nothing, because he was OOP and you were the prior aggressor.", "Should have pot bet the flop, likely doesnt call on a draw. If he does, would assume over cards or a higher pair. IMO.", "Youre practically at the bottom of your range besides stuff like whiffed broadways, and have no blockers to any value. They can easily be value betting stuff like A8 or AK for this sizing as well as flushes, so theyre not exactly repping thin.  They shouldnt be floating a half pot bet on a wet board with naked overs, even with BDFD. They need to find stuff like 66 no heart on the river to have enough bluffs. This person seems like a fish though, so maybe they have some overcardBDFD hands that they get here and bluff with, but still, your bluffcatcher is really bad.  You can checkback turn with a lot of Ax hands. Call river with those.", "I didnt even consider 65s, so that actually makes this so much clearer.  It probably looks bluffy to me because Ive been building my bankroll and am trying to move from 25NL to 50NL online and Ive noticed a lot of 25NL players value betting 1412 pot and 23 as bluffs.  I also see a lot of them checking back top pair on somewhat wet boards like this out of fear so perhaps I subconsciously dimished Ax as a possibility in my head.  But I definitely shouldnt assume all opponents will make the same mistakes that only some make.  Thinking about it more, it actually seems like I lose to pretty much their entire flop checkcall range so this definitely looks like an easy fold.  I had no info on the villain so I probably shouldnt have assumed they were going to run a big bluff their first hand in.  I think I may have gotten into my own head when I saw the turn card and then just decided because itd be so easy to bluff on, Id be bluffed.  But while it was unfortunate in that it pretty much guaranteed villain was ahead, it was obviously way better than some other turns that could have concealed the hands that beat me.", "Yeah, I guess I was just hoping at the end without any logic.  Thanks", "Yeah river definitely should have been a fold.

Theres 3 hearts and an Ace on the board. Youre only going to get called by better. Check is your only play.", "It makes it better but it still wouldnt be a great call. Very few flushes in LJvHJ raisecall range have a 9h. KhTh are much better blockers because they block the suited broadways which can call pre. 9h literally only blocks Th9h unless they call 3bets too wide with stuff like K9sJ9s. So consider calling with ThT through KhK. You could also consider bluff raising those but its kind of hard for you to rep a flush after checking turn and the board has the Ah.  Also I prefer bluffcatching over trying to get a probable fish to fold 2P in a spot you rep thin. 3BB open is not a guarantee that villain is a fish, but its a huge tell.", "Makes sense, thanks", "Can I ask why 3bb open is a fish move", "Its nonstandard and usually indicates that someone isnt very studied.

Early positions face more 3bets and want to be risking less when that happens. At a table where opponents collectively 3bet too little or call too much larger opens can work well. In games where the opponents play reasonably preflop its better to risk the minimum to win the blinds. All youre really trying to do from an overall strategic perspective is win the blinds with your open.", "I get that, and I wouldnt say its the norm at all, but if UTG opens 2bb and say CO calls, you can be sure SB and BB are both calling or raising for the pot odds which can then be awkward for UTG, especially when flop comes J75r.  The 3betting part does make a lot of sense as well, but it feels fine to flat most 3bets for my UTG open range.  Maybe my opening UTG range is too tight then, or maybe my calling range is too loose.

Your inbox probably has several DMs from folks who are agents. Some of them might be good. I suggest ignoring them all unless you are willing to give them money with no expectation of any return.   2. An agent you choose should be someone you know andor trust. There are some big agents that have a good reputation, usually because a real name is attached to the agent. Note that they have to be honest with you, honest with themselves, and understand the stability of the clubs and unions they work with. If they havent seen the books of the club host the top dog, then they are probably in the dark on a lot of things. If you dont know an agent, and you dont go to a card room where someone you trust knows an agent, then maybe dont play on the apps.   3. Dont send any money to an agent unless you are ok never seeing it again. This happens more often than people admit.   4. Rakeback will be arranged through your agent. 30 is good for starters. You can negotiate to higher like 50 or more if you are a high volume player especially if you are a net loser andor if you recruit other players who are active.   5. Ask about how payouts are processed. Specifically, how long they take for certain amounts. Small amounts relatively speaking should be same day. Larger payments usually over 5k, but that may vary may require waiting until the club settles up with the union each week. Know what day that is.

Jordan Peterson didnt enter the political zeitgeist until 2016 when he took on trans pronouns, declaring them the creation of extremeleft ideologues.  His propensity to take on political arguments that are outside his realm of expertise became his calling card of the past halfdecade.  His followers, ardent in their support due to his credentials in unrelated fields, often use his videos of him arguing with illinformed students, dismissing any kind of privilege, particularly white privilege, as a tool of extremist leftists to manipulate people.  This has draw particularly with disaffected white males whose grievances align with the altright.  That white males feel theyve been eroded in the public space, that women, minorities, and that feminists and other activists describe society and that white males feel they are being attacked as the source of these issues.  So, to bring this around to what you say his him telling young men to take responsibility of their lives.  The rules, or, steps, he tells people to take in order to improve their lives, they may seem innocuous, but he ties these steps to a view that validate white men at the expense of everyone else.  While young white men feel validated in his views, the fact that it ONLY seems to extend to white males is a problem.  Or you take the world view that white males are somehow an oppressed group and that minorities and women are the oppressors and TADA, everything he says now makes sense.  So this is why I think hes essentially three sacks of shit in a suit jacket.  He is not some innocent purveyor of feelgoodpickyourselfupselfhelp advice.

On the point on women, Ive never seen him state that women are inherently less competent than men. This is probably a misunderstanding of the fact that the data shows that the distributions for men and women on competence, among other things, shows that males have much flatter curves with fatter tales. Thus men are inherently both more competent AND less competent than women.  He also doesnt believe in climate change  This is also false, and again comes from a superficial understanding of the underlying point being made. The argument being made, one that is based on the work of Bjorn Lomborg, is that the efforts to tackle climate change are a significantly less effective use of resources to improve the lives and conditions of the global poor than a wide variety of other uses of those resources. Furthermore, even specifically trying to tackle climate change directly can be done more effectively both in costs and results than the current direction and efforts.  he promotes a complete quack lion diet  More examples of how superficial understandings from bad faith actors completely misrepresent the original position. I have never seen Dr Peterson endorse the lion diet, and I have actually seen interviews, with Lex Friedman for example, where he specifically states that he doesnt really want to promote it because he isnt sure about the data and the impacts of widely spreading this as an idea. He states that it has worked for him and solved his personal medical problems he was experiencing, not that everyone should resort to only steak and sparkling water.  Hes repackaged the most basic of fucking advice work on yourself first and people praise him for it for ... reasons  Yes, because the repackaging is what turns it into good advice, and it works. It has been incredibly effective at helping a large number of disaffected young men, most of whom didnt have a male role model to teach them this kind of thing. Is it a bad thing that people are being helped en masse by the delivery of what to someone who grew up in a stable setting with access to education and resources might be the bleeding obvious  I really appreciate you providing a prime example of what I was referring to in my previous comment. A superficial, and wildly incorrect, understanding of positions made by Dr Peterson no doubt given by people who actively despise his work means that you disagree with his work for positions he doesnt even hold. That aside Id like to reiterate the main point of my comment even if you dislike his politics, why does that mean he isnt a valid authority for young men who are struggling with direction, such as the OP", "Right, so because you disagree with some of his political points and because youre a racist you dont like him.  political zeitgeist until 2016 when he took on trans pronouns, declaring them the creation of extremeleft ideologues  Youre also wildly misinformed on the topic.

Why does this negate his work to help young men Im very keen to see examples of where he actually tears down other groups or suggests that whites are the superior race. This is a bit pointless to go into in any great detail. Youre a racist and me discussing this with you would be like trying to convince an antisemite that the Jews arent behind anything, a futile waste of time and energy.  Its very interesting that you suggest he is a Ben Shapiro. There are many, many hours of Dr Peterson giving lectures on the human psyche and talking at length on this topic. He also directly debates with a wide and varied array of prominent people on his podcast on his YouTube channel. But youre not aware of any of that because youve bought into the white supremacists are everywhere narrative.  Regardless, much as you would like to believe his advice for young men is aimed at whites in particular the evidence doesnt support this. If you could provide examples of where he tears down other groups Id be very interested to see it, but his advice seems to be entirely predicated on the notion that its all your own fault, so sort yourself out, bucko.  But you hate young, white men, so because theyre the main group who seem to benefit from the work of Dr Peterson a shocking fact that is almost statistically inevitable in Canada, the USA and wider western world we should disregard all of his work and hes obviously evil.

Game usually plays for effective stacks of 1,500 to 5,000.    I have noticed some regs that 3bet wide with suited connectors and call 4bets wide too.  they are usually doing this with position.  I know they should be doing this sometimes, but I doubt their ability to really be balanced here.  I think they are probably overdoing it.  Preflop, it seems like I should be widening my 4bet and call range to adapt, but what would the best way to go about doing this  Should my 4bets be more merged, or polar  For example, hero in LJ facing a 3bet from the button straddle, 200 straddles deep, I am usually calling ATs, sometimes 4betting vs the pool.  Do I 4bet this hand more, or call more  AQs I am almost always calling, should I be 4betting this hand more  What about hands like A5s and A4s  Call more, or 3bet more  I mean, if I am widening my call range, what does that mean  AQo, AJo, A7s  It seems like a hand like ATs is ahead of a fair amount of his 3bet range, but if the board comes K high, even when he wiffs, it is going to be hard to realize my equity without the betting lead.  Another thing I have also noticed if I have a hand like A4s as 4bettor on a flop of KQ8, I am getting called by 87 when I bet 14 pot.  Then I give up turn without a backdoor to improve me a lot.  Maybe I need to be barreling more in these spots even without drawsbackdoors  It also seems like in a 4bet pot, I get peeled light when I go like 14 pot, but have more fold equity when betting 12 pot, so maybe sizing up the flop more would help too.  The other thought I had is check raising more aggressively.  In general I dont think I am playing poorly vs these players.  But I know they are playing noticeably far from equilibrium and I want to know if there is a way I can crush them for it.  Postflop these guys are decent.  They are definitely capable of bluffing, thin value betting, making some big calls and lay downs, etc.  Fighting players, but not absolute stations or maniacs.  Any advice you guys have vs this type of reg", "An Exploit vs Wider 3b4bcall is to increase value portion of 3b4b range. Your premiums are extra premium vs their range, push that edge by raising more and calling less.  regarding postflop, it sounds like you arent considering your actions from start to finish. you should have a general idea if not an actual plan for every card that peels on turn  river. shutting down after one barrel on KQ8 is a tendency that someone could spot and say oh, PeonsRightNow hasnt barreled turn  river unimproved in spots like this after cbetting a good range board, I can punish that by calling those cbets light and either winning with value or bluff on turn and river  ooh also, if youre getting annoyed playing OOP vs a 4bcaller you can start increasing your raise size and get more value while also playing a smaller SPR postflop. they might adjust, but it might not be as sharp as they should and you might even just get called anyways cause its live lol.", "Playing 125 uncapped, if most ppl are 3001000 bb deep value of suited connectors or hands with high nut potential raise in value substantially.", "Use a smaller open. Their 3bet sizing in adjustment to this determines your response. If they adjust by 3betting to a smaller size while theyre IP, this allows you to peel.  If they 3bet too big, then this is inefficient on their part and a normal linear 4bet range will punish them. They are basically overvaluing board coverage but you will have the same when you call the 3bet. When you 4bet and get peeled, 100bb130bb is too low a stack depth for them to play suited connectors and small pocket pairs profitably. If they play deepstacked, just play at 100150bb, take chips off the table. You and most of us have no business playing with more than that in front of you.   Them being able to have all two pairs and straights on a flop of 876 is incorrect unless youre deep. Your stronger range will make more money over the long run. Let them try and repeatedly soul read you with third pair over and over when you can have 20 value combos.  You will have enough triple barrels or betflopshoveturns for value, and also great bluff combos with blockershigh equity draws that will get through or hit.  If theyre 3betting from the blinds too wide, you can 4bet to a smaller size IP with more suited connectors, A2A5s, K9s yourself.  It sounds like you know their barreling tendencies to some extent. So it sounds like you can think it through and decide how to build your bet, check, checkraising ranges accordingly. If they float wide to small cbets, their turn is weaker and you can size up on turn and river.

Dont try to exploit regs who correctly more or less 3betcall 4bet in position.

What OOP 4bet sizing are you using with deep stacks If youre 4betting too small its correct for them to always call the suited connectors they 3bet with. If you 4bet too infrequently it may be correct for them to always 3bet their suited connectors that would normally be mixes.  The fact that they float you with stuff like bottom pair isnt a problem for either of you. Youre using correct cbet sizing in that situation and theyre making correct calls with stuff like 87. 14 is attempting to fold out JJ pocket pairs or worse and those hands should still call sometimes and total whiffs, not 87.  I wouldnt necessarily adjust just based on what youve said, but I would study and drill these spots to make sure youre not leaking. Just based off of the pool of regs I can say youre likely not 4betting enough of your continuing range, not using proper sizing, not barreling enough turns and rivers, or all of the above. Very, very few people play 4bet pots well.", "You can call their 3bets rather than 4bet more then you are now and you have a skinnier range of 4bets that youre happy to go to war with and you have a wider 3bet calling range that you can play off of as well.", "I know, but at the same time, they should be flatting a lot pre, too.  And at equilibrium, they should be folding to 4bets a fair amount too, even folding some facing an open depending on the position.  So there should be exploitative adjustments to counter them overdoing it.  Obviously I need to be careful on low connected boards.  But he is going to be weaker than average on high disconnected boards, which is where I think playing aggressive might pay off.  Im just not sure how much of this should come from calling 3bets lighter, calling downcheck raising in 3bet pots, and how much should come from 4 betting aggressively and continuing agression postflop.

And there is little difference between making them get up and walk around for an hour before coming back with less or them just dropping a buy in into their pocket right there.

Youre in a multiway pot with a K hi flop. Cbetting here is a mistake in most instances.  To answer your question, the best way to improve in these spots is to evaluate how your ranges are constructed. Are you giving yourself strong enough hands to call down in spots where youre checking flops For example, if youre betting all your toppair on a Khi flop, then youre naturally going to have weaker holdings in spots where youre checking the flop and facing TurnRiver bets.   Suppose the flop is K9X and you bet all your K, so the best possible hand you can have in this spot is QQ. Its always going to be tough to call Turn  River doublebarrels in that spot. But suppose you can mix in some hands like KJ, KT, etc, now you calling down two streets can be less stressful.  An observant player will notice your imbalance in your cbet or missed cbet ranges and punish you relentlessly.   Its also important to note that at smaller buyin games, people tend to underbluff so under calling down is not necessarily the wrong play either.", "Why are you cbetting with Queens on a Kinghigh flop into 3 players Its probably a theoretical check anyway, but especially if youre expecting a ton of light checkraising, theres no reason to put yourself into that situation.  Generally speaking the lowstakes live population underbluffs late streets, so overfolding to large aggressive action is usually a reasonable exploit  but if you think these players are bluffing too much, you will have to call down wider than you feel comfortable.

Not in a 4 way pot.", "Are you making it 5x with your entire opening range here, or just with your premium hands 5x is a very large opening size for a tournament, so if youre only doing it with premiums its possible your opponents are picking up on it. Lets be clear though, if you raise 5x and youre getting 3 callers, those opponents are making HUGE mistakes and while it means youre less likely to win any individual hand, youre an enormous favorite in the long run. It can be frustrating to fold when the flop comes Kinghigh, but when it doesnt and you can comfortably shove the rest of your stack in after a raise to 5x and 3 callers the pot is 20 bbs and you had 25 to start, right, youll scoop a much larger pot than you would have heads up.

A common move is to check back, looking to play a 2street game instead. They dont usually realize much equity from a free card, e.g. A5 on K94 has 3 outs vs QQ, many hands are drawing only to backdoors. Ensuring 0 chips go in on the flop makes it harder for them to bluff or value bet us effectively.

As early as the second level people are often preflop betting 35k so 5x often does not yield any folds. This is mostly in reference to the earlymid levels where the BB is under 1k. I think most people simply play off their stack size rather than what is relevant to the blinds. A 7x raise should be a indication of a strong hand but even that rarely gets you heads up. People call with way more hands than they should.", "I also try not to change my raise sizes based on hand strength. I usually increase it based on my position and how many limpers are in the pot.", "While I agree with the check, clearly, its worth noting that no GTO calculations are accessible to the public in 4way spots, way way too complex", "Its weird to me when people ask whether they should risk more to help their opponents make better decisions.", "I think part of your issue here is not adjusting your sense of hand strength based on flop texture and action. Queens is a premium hand preflop, and a marginal hand four ways on a Kinghigh board. Trying to feel like youre somehow entitled to take down the pot because you had a great hand preflop is a common mistake. You wont win every pot you start with a premium hand, and thats fine.  Also I missed that this was a 5x raise over 3 limpers, that sizing is absolutely fine and you could consider going even larger, you can even just shove Queens here at 25bbs over three limpers.

BB fairly solid but sometimes likes a gamble deliberates for a while, talking about how if he hits, hes sorted for the night, and eventually calls.

Input the collective range for the other two players and see how Qd9d does against it.  I would imagine your equity is going to be high enough to call. 6306  16.7 equity minimum needed. I dont have it installed but my muscle memory tells me the overcards to 8x, and the 3 worse flush combos you dominate is enough to give you to that equity, even though king and nut flush draws fuck you. Equilab will quantify that for you so you dont need to count the outs like this.  The bigger problem is that youre pricing yourself into calling with the wrong hands. Its a wheel draw board and you dont have the nut flush draw. This is also a board where a number of high equity hands WANT to get it in against an overpair, since theyll likely have an overcard to most of your overpairs.  A lot of hands have 40 equity or are flipping, which mean they only need you to fold 1015 of the time to be EV.  I think all the hands you play want to make this 2 streets, not 3, at this stack depth. So while others are advocating a smaller cbet size, that would make a turn allin like 1.25x pot size bet. That might be good but youre less likely to be called off by 8x which is the main hand you want to double through.  So your bet size is probably correct and most convenient imo as a turn shove will be for 1x pot if one person calls flop. However, I would not put worse than kinghigh flush draws in this line. You dont need to bluff anything that youre forced to fold.  Its 4 ways, they know you can have tons of overpairs, but the most determining factor is they want to GII even against your value 99QQ, maybe up to KK  Meaning youre allowed to underbluff and only choose your best flush draws. The whole point of balance is to get your value bets called and bluffs folded to, but you will get people playing into your value regardless.", "Yeah, in general I would raise smaller with this stack size, but at this particular game Ive been pushing my raise size gradually upwards, as people are prone to call a bit too wide, especially if you minraise.

I did a little bit of research about why 7 card stud declined in casinos and the answer seems straight forward, compared to holdem, slower game, smaller stakes, which means less money over a longer period of time for the casino on rakes  As far as why 7 card stud declined in home games the prevailing attitude seems to be the similar to the casinos, slower game, slower hands, smaller stakes, and in my opinion the number 1 reason its much much harder to learn and play then holdem   But my question is this, what did the old timers like about this game that other games didnt provide   My theory is this, 7 card stud is to Texas holdem what hearts of iron 4 is to call of duty, one is much harder, takes much longer to learn, much more involved, and is played by far less people then the other  Basically 7 card stud is the hardcore version of holdem   But I cant help but wonder if 7 card stud provided other benefits, because it was slower and the bets were smaller, I wonder if that alone helped keep out idiots who went all in before the flop That because I was a longer smaller game it helped you work the man you were against rather then just game  I cant help but wonder what was it about 7 card stud that old timers liked  And I can help but wonder how if Americas change from stud to holdem represents in a broader sense how America gambles at large  What do you think", "I find stud games are really mentally draining to play if you remember all the upcards", " slower game, smaller stakes, which means less money over a longer period of time for the casino on rake  1. Slower eh maybe. Very little Hollywooding in limit games.   2. Smaller stakes No. Limit games are typically at higher blind levels. So a small nlhe game might have 12 blinds, while a small stud game might have 24 blinds with 4 small bet and 8 big bet called 48 7cs. 200 buy ins common at both.   3. Less rake Definitely not. Limit games generate relatively big pots almost every hand, so the cap is frequently hit. The same is not true for nlhe. Also, action in limit games is usually quite fast, since there are no bet sizing decisions.   There is one big reason 7cs fell to the wayside, imho. The skill gap between casuals and regs is massive. A casual sitting in a stud game full of regulars wont last long. I think the same is true of limit holdem, but the casual will last slightly longer. With nlhe, casuals can last long enough and sometimes even win to the point that they dont realize that they are longterm losing players.   This last point, that unskilled players often dont realize how bad they are due to the structure of the game, is what has given nlhe its legs.   I think that long term this trend will continue. Specifically, plo will get more popular, but bigger than that, I think that bomb pot games will become standard at some point in cash games. See every flop gamble gamble, but get unlucky when you get stacked by a bigger hand.   My personal hope is that mixed games also become more popular, and that might happen at higher stakes cash, but Im not holding my breath.", "I think its a multi variable answer but the best I can think of is that the decline of 7 card stud and limit style poker came with the boom of NLH and the money maker effect. NL became the variant that is broadcasted on tv so all the newrecreational players flocked to that. Because players flocked to it, in turn so did the pros. Thus, as NL became the most popular variant of poker, the others slowly declined in popularity and now most rooms have NL as their most popular game.", "If we really want to play another game 27 singletriple draw is where the real fun is.", "As someone who got into casino poker before the Moneymaker boom and sat primarily at 7 card stud the mix of games in the room was maybe 50 stud, 40 holdem and a random Omaha8 table.  Stud always seemed more intuitive to me as its your own hand with no board. In a time before cellphones and tablets it was fully engaging. To play well you have to pay attention to the up cards that are dealt and factor that into A your own outs, B outs for your opponents C similar to B, putting your opponents on hands given known cards. D What hands you can represent and eliminating opponent holdings  Unlike reading a board you never know what is the stone cold nuts. Back to the rise of screens you can look up from whatever youre doing at holdem, read thr board and know where your hand stands. A few times a session youll see some cooler hands. Flush over flush, hidden boats, these hands will pile money into a pot. As to bets it is overwhelmingly played in a limit format and a player cant just jam all in out of nowhere.   As to the speed of the game the hands may play a little longer but live Id guess 20 handshr v. 25 at HE.   I really think the boom is what did in stud games. It drew in tons of new players but they all wanted to play HE like on TV. Rooms will spread what people want and even the better stud players could see the feeding frenzy at HE so eventually the stud list gets shorter and less games run and even those on the list would sit at a holdem table until a seat opened and maybe just stay there if it was good.

The only NL stud Ive ever seen is in movies.   The second is that hold em is just easier to learn to a second level of nuance and has some fun emergent properties like  you cant have to suits of flushes on the same board so everyone is drawing to the same flush, kicker problems, the fact that you go from 2 to 5 cards in one street making more pocket pairs continues preflop.

On the river you have every reason to believe youre good, most people would be raising flop or turn with 99 and its a great runout. For hands beating you, that arent trapping the flop, they would have to be A5s56s of diamonds, or 34 of clubs. So he can have legit hands that call flop, call turn, raise river.  However, some players are chronic slowplayers, so definitely make a note of that if he has a tendency to lean toward slowplaying.  He had the rare set, but the main consideration on the river is, if hes not 3betting preflop a lot, he could very well have AJ.  So its basically how to balance maximizing value vs. JTQJ and minimizing value cut vs AJ. 8 AJ combos vs. between 416 JTQJ depending on if he plays only JTs, or JTo as well. So Id just 23rds bet if this guy is calling offsuit combos, or checking river if hes only calling suited.  Its weird when you lower your bet size in relation to the pot on the river. It can cause guessing games because it might induce bluff raises because they think he was beating 23rds on flop and turn, now hes betting less than that. I would betfold KJ and then call AJ.

This strategy adjustment carries through to turn and river. When youre choosing your sizes on turn and river, stacks behind and the pot size are obviously relevant.

It sounds like the coach is using SPR as a quick way to help make certain decisions that are based on stacks and the pot. This is fine. Anything that helps you make decisions in game is a good thing.

Four thousand twenty years ago there was an infamous savage Viking lord named Ragnar the magnanimous. He roved and pillaged all of Nova Scotia for the first sixty nine years of his life, but he began to dream of more. He desired plunder and riches not known to the men of his time, to venture beyond the shores he had known his entire life. Ragnar gathered his crew and told every man that if they joined for the adventure, they may never return. All but one cheered and rushed aboard. Vilani, staying behind on the shore, mused that they deserved a greater cut of plunder due to the greater risk of the adventure. Ragnar would not hear it, Men, to your oars He roared, preparing to shove off. Vilani had other plans though, shouting back HEADS UP 4 ROLLz and so the first villain was born. Ragnar punted his stack pretty quickly and wouldnt shut the fuck up about how he was the hero when posting on 22 for the next thousand years to figure out what he did wrong.", "hero villain is so fucking cringe i wish it never existed, save it for anime movies  how hard is it to say i and my opponent like a normal person does in any other game", "Thanks", "I didnt even know my ex mother in law had a Reddit account.

This can be simplified further down by getting rid of some of the flops that are too similar to one another, and condensed to like half of that, so lets say 12.  In 6 max, theres 15 positional HU matchups. UTG vs HJ, CO, BTN, SB, BB is 5.  HJ vs CO, BTN, SB, BB is 4.  CO vs BTN, SB, BB is 3.  You can simplify this by further by grouping together UTG and HJ as early position, and CO and BTN as late position. Then lets say for sake of simplification theres 5 positional matchups in 6max poker.  So thats 60 combinations of flops  pairs of positions in headsup pots to study. You can input one of these flops into GTO Wizard for free thats what I do, more hardcore players will use pioisolver or something, and study just that flop and make up your own runout, to learn how these are supposed to be optimally played.  You can do that in 45 months and learn the bet sizes, visualize whats being done with different parts of the range, and master your flop play. Youll understand how some hands being played on the turn lead to the other player needing to do x on the river.  But, what about the turn and river  Well, learning turn and river play is already built into this process of studying the 60 spots which are going to be full runouts the 12 or 15 flops you take from the list, plus your own turns and rivers that you input.  Those 60 spots turns  river you come up will capture all the times it comes running straights, board pairing, backdoor flush, 4 or 5 flush, etc.  It will show you why you should do x on the river, based on what the other position is doing with y part of their range on the turn. The principles you learn directly from the solution can be osmosed and applied to the turn and rivers you havent seen. There is a overarching logic to where your bluffs come from, when to give up, and where the borderline is to calling vs. folding.  Once youre only a dozen hands, a few weeks, into the process, you will be able to come up with your own answers for what to do when players deviate from what GTO wizard or the other solvers are doing.  If you were seriously trying to move up to 200nl z or 500 nl z and higher, and to treat it as basically a job, whats what itd take. If you were going to play another 10,000 hands next month, that time can be used to thoroughly learn 1520 spots. Its its own kind of grind but for me I dont find grinding through thousands of hands without really improving fun. All the people stuck in the micros year after year are there because they havent bothered to learn the game.

Im considering a Masters degree, and may pursue a career in the near future.", "I thought what happened to Chad Batista was very sad. He was not treated by many with the respect he deserved, in large part because of his background, but he was an extremely nice guy and an incredible talent. One example is that a now famous pro was invested in him and there was some controversy involving Chad thinking Bryn was going to scam him after a big tournament score. Bryn and several people confronted him outside the Rio on a break and Bryn struck him in the face, even though Chad was like a 100 pound guy. Chad drank, a lot, and ended up moving to Mexico to play online MTTs, where he slowly drank himself to death. I think he actually passed away in Vegas about a year after I last saw him. He was one of the nicest people Ive known.", "ActionJeff he posted it up the thread a ways", "ActionJeff", "Ill have to put some thought into that one. I had no mentors, and by the time I needed one, I was playing for too much money and would have been potential competition for any better players who could have helped me.  The thing that was really important for me and a lot of the best online players I knew, is that we all had people we talked poker with, a lot. Didnt matter if it was while playing, traveling, going out for dinnerall of the top players I knew had likeminded people they socialized with and discussed poker with.  As far as gameplay, at some point very early on I realized I needed to randomize my play and make decisions in terms of frequencies, and adjust them based upon other factors. This required some study, which I didnt do nearly enough of, but it mostly required a very good intuition, and I think that was my strength, and was the reason that I was able to compete at the level I did despite the holes in my game compared to superior players like Scott Seiver.  The most important adjustment I made to my game was to start thinking about my play in terms of realizing the showdown value of my hands more often, which seems so obvious but changes everything. Learning to play to exploit other technically weaker players was also very important.", "I played a night multitabling 300600 NL against Urindanger where at one point I was up something like 1.5M,and ended up either winning or losing by a few buyins. I was playing poorly at the end too, and almost quit when I was up the most, but kept playing because he politely asked me to lol. Another thing I remember is him telling me that one day I would wish I had cared more about money. Smart guy.", "I didnt have personal experience with too many shady people.

Hes not someone I would want to dislike me. Ive played with him a few times, and while his play isnt intimidating, its very effective. I feel the same about Hellmuth re unimposing but effective play.", "Its not that tough mentally, but there was a long transition period. The thing is that even if I made 50 an hour now, it would still be a pittance compared to my income in the past. I feel relatively secure as far as my future, so Im lucky in that way. Otherwise Id likely still be playing. I do think Ill be able to increase my income in the intermediate future.", "I dont think it was as far behind as people seem to think, at least looking at the very, very top players. Many of those guys are still at the top, for whatever thats worth.  Im familiar with a lot of advancements.

If I get the itch Ill let you know.", "I didnt play there enough to have any good stories. I was invited to some pretty soft private games there by Kenny Tran and won a lot and wasnt invited back. That was the last summer I played high stakes.  Never played Zig live. I did once play a 40k SNG with several Scandis and a Japanese billionaire in Monte Carlo. Im spacing on his name, maybe Kagawa He took 2nd to me in a HU event in Melbourne too. When we were all done playing and he went to settle up, he brought a briefcase and opened it and the entire thing was full of money. He pulled out some number of hundreds of thousands of Euros that appeared to barely make a dent in what was there, and with a smile handed it over to Johnny Lodden. He didnt seem to care he had lost, even a little.", "I think I could handle it without major issues. Working hard to understand solver strategies would be hardest.

Definitely a guy I respect, and the same goes for Ike.  They were both better players than I was, better technical games, better connected to other top players to brainstorm with, harder worker, and less of the type of issues I had that caused me problems. So, I didnt keep playing while they did for many reasons.      Ill respond to more questions tomorrow. This has been fun", "I didnt really know him well. I cant recall ever hanging out. We were both friends with Nat Arem and we talked strategy together sometimes. He was really into steals from mid position in MTTs, and the best thing about his cash game play was how tight he played.", "All of them. I thought critically about poker all the time, played a lot, and discussed hands a lot, even with somewhat lower level players.", "Everyone studied a lot. I watched other players, I spent hundreds of hours reading books and analyzing databases, even more time talking to other players, and played millions of hands, always thinking critically while playing, as opposed to just grinding mindlessly. I was constantly trying to improve my game.", "I never played anyone live who I was particularly intimidated by. Durrr was probably the scariest person to play, but I only ran into him in MTTs. Online, Durrr and Scott Seiver were the scariest players. I think Scott was the best NLHE player in the world, and Hoss TBF was the best all around online player.   I didnt, to my knowledge, cross paths with any serious criminals directly as a result of playing poker.", "Summer 2009 was really cool. I stayed in a giant house with some of my best friends and we all grinded. Went out for some great meals, and I got to see the player I looked up to the most, my friend Leo Wolpert, win the 10k heads up.   Im not sure if poker has been a net positive on my life. I had amazing experiences I wouldnt have had otherwise and I met some remarkable people. Poker also corrupted me in some ways, and hurt my mental health, and it took time to recover from some of it.", "I played a lot of 510 NL 6 max on FTP, and was winning at something like double the winrate of the next best player, over a pretty big sample. Thats where my response here comes from. The players at this level were technically strong preflop, but much weaker postflop. They also were predictable, and they were bad at balancing out scenarios where there are weaker players everyone wants to exploit. When that happens, good players make themselves exploitable by taking advantage of the fisher players, and the rest of the table adjusts to that. If you play the same in this scenario as when youre at a table of strong players, youre missing out on so much value.  Im not sure how to describe the meta at HSNL cash. It shifted quickly and the games varied a lot.", "When I was losing, I played shorter sessions and dropped stakes. When I made particularly bad decisions, I took a break or stopped.   Besides giant quick swings at nosebleeds, my biggest downswing was around 250k at Stars 2550 NL. I did a stat analysis after that and found I was playing poorly. There was a large stretch where I was losing money with AQo utg. That game was actually pretty tough by 2010 ish.  When I had that insane session against Urindanger, I cashed out my roll from FTP besides 300k or so. I gave money to my parents because I didnt want to risk burning it.", "At poker I dont think theres any one specific thing. You need intelligence and cleverness. You need to be hard working, and you also need a lot of passion for the game. All that, and its still not enough if you dont have the right mental and emotional disposition to handle the game.", "I dont know any modern resources. Beating those stakes live should equip you for MTT success. Do you feel like youre able to take advantage of weaker players Are you appropriately valuing conserving your stack", "Yeah, I think it was tougher. There were some really, really good players in that game. I would compare that game to a game youd see on a high stakes show where theres a few cash game kings, a couple OK players, and a few fish, and everyone is playing with a straddle. The best players in that game were very creative, as opposed to just possessing great technical skills.  When I wanted to move to cash games, I purchased a database from a player named BldSwtrs, who was the biggest winner in those games, to the tune of millions of dollars. I learned so, so much from analyzing it, both about playing a technically strong game, and manipulating table dynamics. He was an amazing player.", "I mentioned playing him a little elsewhere. I didnt know him personally and the stakes we played didnt overlap much during my career. I did watch him play live once, and thought he had really impressive table presence. I didnt know who he was and I said to my friend Alex that player looks like hes extremely good and he laughed.", "Intelligence, creativity, passion, stability, and patience.", "Viffer trash talked me, causing me to leave a very soft game where I was up like 200k while having 100 of myself. I paid him off on a river and he said something like every game needs fish. Kenny Tran had to really regret inviting me to that game. He said something like you are not playing like you did before in the WSOP 40k.  That was the first time I played Brandon Adams. Ive never played anyone before who projected more intelligence. He is one of those rare guys who immediately makes you go man, this guy seems really, really smart even without talking.

I played high stakes for that period, but was only playing nosebleeds for around 3 years basically late 2006 to late 2009. I didnt have access to the biggest live games.     As far as why I didnt make more money, well I didnt play nearly enough volume, I punted hard sometimes, especially at the end, and above all, I wasnt a good enough player to crush at that level, especially with some of the issues I was struggling with.

With a hand like JTo, are you really hoping for the minute chance that this hand will hit a straight The probability it will hit a straight is very low, compared to the amount of money that youll actually get when you your straights. Much less when you consider the effect of rake. Definitely a EV play. A lot of the EV from playing JTo heads up is hitting top pair, which is often outkicked multiway.  K3s is better, but its still bad, as flushes are very rare. The EV of the decision to overlimp with K3s is definitely less than breakeven.

Live theres a lot more disincentive to raise and more incentive to call because you can be facing 3 limpers with very wide ranges quite frequently.  I think you underestimate the impact of low frequency outcomes on EV. Yes, its rare to make the nuts, but a lot of our EV comes from these low frequency nodes where we get stacks in with the nuts.

Of course we arent only playing for that, but there are tons of other situations where we can get one pair to showdown in a checkeddown pot and win, or win a medium pot with a weak flush or two pair, or steal an orphan pot nobody wants, or find some semibluffs with a hand that has a lot of ways to flop some kind of equity.  The primary value of 53s isnt from making flushes. It can win stacks when it makes nut straights, and second nut straights on textures where the nut straight isnt likely. We like having the suit because it gives us more ways to flop equity and win more smallmedium sized pots.   The EV of the decision to overlimp with K3s is definitely less than breakeven.

I recently played at a live poker room and asked the pitboss what the secret was to walking in there and winning consistently.  He said You just have to be patient  And how true that is.  Just be patient, wait, and your 108 will hit a sneaky flush that someone is going to triple you up on.  Now hear me, they are going to have the higher flush sometimes.  But please dont donk off the rest of your chips in frustration, use them to WAIT, because another flush will come, and this time it will pay you over 3 times.

Sometimes you are at a table with aggro players and its best to wait for your monster, rather than try to defend your 2nd pair.   DONT DONK IT DONK IT   The old adage a chip and a chair is so true.  If you lose a big pot, dont donk the rest of your chips off You can use these to recoup and possibly save your session.

Then the fictional Negreanu realizes that shes really really good and finds himself in a situation where if he screws up, shell surely win against the other opponent. He misplays she wins the crucial hand but gets maybe a tiny bit too aggressive two hands later and knocks herself out on the bubble in a perfectly fine way like losing a flip. But with this overall result, she realizes that her old life was left behind and that theres a safety and security and comfort and enjoyment about finally finding something she can dedicate her effort toward... and she realizes that poker is fun, but not everything. The fictional Negreanu sees her off at the Las Vegas airport. Its unknown where she is going.

There are two timeframes in my novel  one in flashbacks from 30 years ago, the other timeframe is now. Heres the relevant passage from the 30 years ago timeframe the Loon here is unnamed but is a quicktalking smartass who also happens to be a Lawyer because the Loon went to Loon Law School  The Loon looked at Marvin and the Loon said Oh. Its like magic dust from the Golden Dragon and all that. Okay Magic dust. I can find anybody anywhere. And I can serve subpoenas... and I can serve depositions... because Im a lawyer. But thats besides the point.   I wanna tell you about the plan. The plan with my brothers Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles. Ricky. Julian. Bubbles. Thats three brothers. Okay And heres the plan... you ready  I looked at the Loon and I said Okay.  Marvin looked at the Loon and he said Okay.  Susanna looked at the Loon and she said Okay, bring it on, Loon... Whats the plan  And so the Loon continued Well, okay, so... Loons have like a twoyear growth or gestational period until theyre adults, okay They tend to get born in the Springtime. And the following Winter, around the nine month mark, they get some new feathers on them and theyre almost an adult. But, in any case, within two years of... uh... being born... the loons  the new baby loons  are actually adults and therefore they can have their own loon children, okay In two years. A twoyear period between generations.   So I got three brothers Ricky. Julian. Bubbles. And weve got about twentyeight or so years, maybe twentynine, until the dragons come back. Okay If you take that out, weve got about fifteen generations. Okay Now, heres the plan  Ricky and Julian and Bubbles over in Nova Scotia have agreed that theyll have three loon children each. And theyll instruct those children to have three children each. And theyll further instruct those children to instruct their children... and so on... to have three children each. So with three of them beginning and fifteen generations to go... since were already starting with three... its like an exponential growth. And so, in the end, were gonna end up with like three to about the sixteenth power of loons.  We were all good with math, so we realized that this was going to come out to a very large number of loons that would be available to fight Kamalas dragons when, and if, they returned in the future... twentyeight or so years in the future.   We didnt know exactly how much it was. It was actually me who finally asked the Loon, So we got, like... Well, we get it. We all understand exponential growth here. But... well... how many loons is this gonna be for us when we need them, twentyseven or twentyeight years in the future  The Loon looked at me and he looked at Marvin and he looked at Susanna and the Loon said to all of us Okay. So Three to the sixteenth power. I got three brothers. Each has three children. Each children has three children. Each children of those has three children and so on. Sixteen generations. And, uh, that comes out to... ummm... uhh... fortythree million fortysix thousand sevenhundred twentyone loons.  My jaw dropped. Susannas jaw dropped. Marvins jaw dropped. That just means we were surprised because... Well, it took us all a moment to get the grips of ourselves together.   It was eventually Susanna who said to the Loon, So, ummm, youre saying that were going to have about fortythree million loons to deal with Kamalas dragons when the time comes  And the Loon replied, Yes, yes. That is correct. If you want to be specific, best estimate right now is fortythree million fortysix thousand sevenhundred and twentyone loons.  We all said, That is pretty good.", "Maybe.

Other than that, hands with high implied odds, such as A5s and suited connectors or suited kings because they block hands such as AK or KK also play well as bluffs.  Hands like QJo have pretty decent equity but do terribly against a 4B range, largely because theyre easily dominated by AQ, KQ, AJ, KJ.

Hands like A9o tend to have pretty bad reverse implied odds multiway if you end up in a big pot, youre often going to have the second best hand.  As played, our opponent has bet flop into 3 other opponents, bet turn and bombed river. They might be loose but they have a lot of better Ax, 2 pair and sets in their range that they would want to play this way compared to the BB calling range. Flushes are underrepresented because of the board texture As and Ks are accounted for, but they still can have QsJs, JsTs etc.  I think call flop and turn are fine based on sizings, and we can pick off bluffs e.g. QJo that might give up on river.

I get some heat from players on my style and others say I am not wrong at all. I am sure there will be people on both sides here as well and I will try to be as honest as I can for my reasons.   First situation is  Heads up after river. Player 1 bets I call. Player 1 instantly mucks his hand, dealer pushes pot my way, Player 1 demands to see my cards. I decline and say I do not have to show as I am the only live player with cards. Player 1 complains it is a called bet and he has a right to see. I disagree. What if I am the last player with live cards and I then muck my hand  Second situation and this is where I get some heat, but I will be honest as to the WHY  Heads up after the river, Player 1 bets I call. Player 1 declares You got it or You win something of the sort. I say nothing and do not reveal my cards. Player 1 still holds his cards and says What do you have I say  I called you He says You win just show your hand I say either muck your hand or show it Player 1 says I have bad etiquette and should not make him show. I say Player 1 should stop tying to bluff me and should learn his lesson. Player 1 gets angry. Player 1 turns over busted 9 high straight draw, I show top set. Player 1 says it is BS that I made him show. I tell him directly, I am training you to not want to bluff me, because everytime you do, I will force you to show garbage He is more than pissed.   This goes back to the first situation for when he mucks and demands to see my hand. I know that no matter what I show I win, but if he mucks, I dont show period. He thinks in order to win the pot I have to show both cards. Of course he is right if there is anyone left live in the hand. But I am not giving him any info if I dont have to.   So, am I wrong to force a bluffing player to show first or much if I CALL HIM. Is this frowned upon  I did notice this player tries to bluff me less when he knows I will make him show. I have even said to him as he is cutting out chips I will make you show Which usually makes him check.   I just want to know if you think I am breaking some unwritten poker rule by trying to embarrass him And yes that is definitely part of the fun for me. Not to mention the mega tilt he goes on after I do it.", "First situation is a house rule. Ive played in casinos where the last live hand has to show regardless. If its okay to muck then let the dealer push you the pot and muck. I dont think its bad etiquette to not show if you dont have to.  The second one, bad etiquette and strategy. Youre holding up the game in order to see the hand of someone whos told you they have air just to get a sliver of info or embarrass them a bit. Im sure some will say its info youre entitled to but its probably not all that useful, and its generally ev to keep the game moving quickly. Get a few more hands per hour instead of having players argue about showing air. Be a player fish actually want to play with. And why would you want to train them not to bluff into top set Stop tapping the glass. Plus, it wouldnt be the first time I saw someone forced to show and then realise they actually had something. Not common, but live donks can misread flushes and straights.", "You are correct.   You called him. He has the choice to either show or muck. If he shows, you have to show hence the name showdown in order to win the pot. If he mucks, you do NOT need to show your hand.   I tell him directly, I am training you to not want to bluff me, because everytime you do, I will force you to show garbage  Dont say that. That will probably happen all by itself anyway. Just stick to pointing out the rules and leave it at that IMHO.", "I think youre technically right in both situations.

You cant stop him mucking though. If he shows, you have the option to muck or show. If he refuses, HE is the one slowing the game down. Others can have a go at him.

I despise people who do this. You bet, show your cards or muck asshole", "First sit  Never ever seen this house rule. Mucking is folding all over the world. Hand dead.  Edit agree with reaction on second. Dont make this a hobby. Itll bounce back some time. Although technically you are correct. Maybe Ive done something like this a couple of times in 30 years just to steam someone for later pay.", "What would happen to the pot if he mucks then I muck after without showing  And as for holding up the game, he is still hanging onto his cards. If he mucks as soon as I call there is no waiting. He is demanding I show first before he mucks after I CALLED HIM If he thinks I have the winner as in he bluffed with Air, why does he need to see my hand  If he turns over garbage of course I show immediately to take the pot. Or as has been the case with this player not against me he says you win, you show a decent hand, he turns over the stone nuts. He says you win to get to see your hand. Because if he shows nuts, most muck and he does not get to see .", "I appreciate your feedback. And exactly why I do tell him that I am training him is so he gets the lesson. And now on top of the possibility of losing chips when he bluffs at it, he also is risking losing face and looking silly. So that is my reason. Of course I always give the option that he simply mucks. But I am never showing my hand first when I call a bet. I am not sure how this became bad etiquette when the rule is clear. Thanks again.", "I do not see it as tapping the tank. Simply put, if I call someone they are supposed to show first. If they do not want to show they can muck and the hand moves on. But when they bluff and want to hang onto their cards to give an image of having something at all, I do not want to help them with that nor do I want to encourage them to continue running bluffs against me. But big thanks for your input.", "Maybe I wasnt clear. When I say Ive played in casinos where the last live hand has to show regardless. If its okay to muck then let the dealer push you the pot and muck. I mean that you have the last live hand all other players have already mucked and the dealer has awarded you the pot. Then muck.  Never toss your hand in unless youre deliberately folding or the pot is already yours. But I have played places in the UK in the past where they had a two for a winner rule that meant you could not claim a pot unless you showed. To be honest, Id prefer cash to be like tourneys Ive played in where all hands go up at showdown. It ends any of the time wasting arguments.", "What would happen to the pot if he mucks then I muck after without showing  Depends on the casino. I never give up my hand until the pot has been awarded to me. Im just saying Ive played in places UK where they had a two for a winner rule meaning you have to show both cards to win any pot. Always protect your hand and youll never have to worry about house rules. If you have to show then the dealer will say so.  If the player says Ive got it then Ill take their word for that. Ill sometimes announce my hand, like say Ive got top pair or Ive got top set. My interest is keeping the game moving and keeping a good atmosphere. Be someone that other people want to play with even if youre beating them especially in smaller places where youll face regs multiple times. Get invited back to that home game. Get more hands in.  If they slowroll me then, okay, next time Im going to say that. Sorry, you slowrolled me last time, its you to show. But them anglingslowrolling you in the past really changes the context of the OP.

First, if they do I cannot always make a correct call. And secondly if they always bluff it is much more difficult for me to rebluff than bluff. I do understand bluffing is part of the game, but I simply believe that if you bluff or I bluff once called it is over. I always act immediately. I can muck or show. My issue is that once I call the bluff, bad bet or donk play whatever it happens to be, it is on the other player to advance the action. The action is ON THEM. They cannot just push the action back to me. But again we do not have to agree on the situation. When action is complete in a hand and I call YOUR bet YOU are obligated to either show or muck. I do not have to make it easy for you to save face.", "Youre not wrong about them having to show. When I get caught bluffing or called on a value bet I just snap roll it over every time.   However, You just are costing yourself money as fishwhales will never want to play with you or give you action.", "And against you this would never be an issue. But if I called your bet be it a bluff, value bet or any other bet and you now refuse to show your cards and just keep telling me to show, I am not going to reward this behavior by obliging you. My reasons for making you show are irrelevant I believe. If the fishwhale wants to bluff he will bluff. But he will also know that he will have to show. Which will affect his decision to try and run that bluff. Again please understand I am not the one whos action it is currently on. I absolutely want to wait. Because if I show my hand, I give off information that I may not have to give off. Such as exactly how light I will call you and at the same time I get zero information back as far as what you were chasing or how light you will try to bluff. Rule wise I believe I am correct in waiting to show until my opponent shows.

You know, with tournaments, there is usually the buyin plus a registration fee. Well, in a cash game, the casino takes a small piece of every pot, usually up to 5, depending on the size of the pot.

For example, a casino may take 5 out of a 25 pot at a microstakes table, and that size pot is very typical for such a low limit table. Versus, in higher stakes, that same 5 is usually being taken out of pots that are 50100, or even higher, of course, as the stakes are raised.  Its just terrible value when you consider the  of rake taken from each pot in microstakes.

So ill play low pairs and mid pairds and such and win a fair amount, but my question is  Is it more of a gamble in general at low stakes because they are willing to call literally everyhing Or is the method to just play as the tightest nit in the entire world and only throw money in when you have the complete nuts  I really hate when i have HP with kings or something and 34 pot raise on the flop then someone with 63o calls and hits a set or two pair on turn and river lol.

I used to play a lot more. Now I only come out once in a blue moon.  So I played an interesting hand, would appreciate if anyone is up for letting me know my mistakes or if my line was reasonable.  Majority of the players at the 8handed table were regulars, I recognized about 6 of the 8. Ive been at the table for 4 hours. Ill assign numbers to rate my assessment of skill 14 4 is best  SB1 200 worst player on the table, very fishy. Just getting stacked and pulling out more money  BB4 200 LAG image, tends to overbet as bluff or when hes got it  HERO UTG1 480 TAG image, very LAG when I first sat down but I really slowed down and made good laydowns on some big hands, table generally picked up on me slowing down  VillainCO3 600, had me covered. Hes kind of a loosesolid player. Ive seen him go all the way with 3rd or 4th best hands and lose the showdown. But generally made some good plays and some questionable plays. Definitely had some decent poker knowledge and Ive seen him here as a regular.  Button2 121 Just sat down, no assessment  Pre Flop 5 Hero is UTG1 with Th Td  1 fold, Hero opens to 15, 4 calls  15 my standard open at this point, Ive shown AA, AKs, toptier hands at 15. Other players generally perceptive enough to know big hands at the top of this betting range.  Flop 70 Js 7d 2h 5 players  2 checks, Hero bets 50, COvillian calls, BTN calls, SB folds, BB calls.  Feels like a pretty safe flop for me. Checked to me, the preflop raiser. I bet out 50. My thought process here is that its a pretty dry board. I can continue repping a big overpair. Only real draw at the moment is a gutshot, so Im pricing that to fold. Also, any weak Jacks may even consider folding. QQKKAA, I wouldve heard about  it already preflop. I feel pretty good, so I bet out assuming I get maybe 1 J caller who I put to the test later streets. I also assume if SB, BB, or BTN had 2pairset, theyll raise because of stack size and I can quietly give up. BB the type to shove with a strong J or better. Assuming if CO were that strong, he COULD slowplay it because of stack size. Instead, I get 4 calls.  Turn 269 9s 4 players  1 check, Hero bets 150. CO calls, BTN calls allin for 56, BB folds.  So this is interesting for me. I turn a gutshot and Im most definitely behind with 3 callers into the turn. Because of the flop action, though, I dont think BTN or BB are strong hands, or their chip stackprevious play would have gone in by now. So this bet is intended to put them to the test, though I admit I probably fucked up here because BTNs chip stack is sized to call even with a weak Jack. At this point, I still want to continue to represent a big overpair, so I bluff out with a gutshot draw. My thought process here is that if CO calls, hes definitely just coming along with a strong J at best, and trapping with a set because J2 or J7 doesnt make any sense at worst. But ideally, Id hope the semibluff would get 3 folders and I win it right there.  River 436 main pot, 188 side pot. 8s 3 players, 1 allin  Hero bets out allin 265, CO calls.  Yahtzee, my semibluff worked. Ive been repping a strong overpair trying to induce a J fold. I backdoor the straight instead. Id bet my life Im ahead at this point. Theres no way CO calls each street with anything weaker than a strong J but Im putting him on a set at this point. And the 2 pairbackdoorflush would have been 7s2s, which hes not going to call preflop on. I also figure I block the other straights with my TT, and if he had QT and call each street, then it is what it is. Im almost certain hes calling with a set of 7s or 2s based on the action.  x200B  How did I do  x200B  Villain turns over Qs Ks. I didnt see that in a milllion years. Though in hindsight I suppose I miss As7s or As2s, but hed have to call 150 into 419 on the turn to get the backdoor. Im not sure... Im sure I messed up a few times, but how bad was it", "Pre   If 15 is getting 4 calls from EP you should open larger. Try 20 or 25 or more if you have to.

Your line and reasoning behind everything is just a giant clusterfuck.  Preflop is standard.  Flop bet is a complete punt, no reason to bet into a flop. People calling lightly preflop arent going to fold anything better on the flop, like someone whos playing junk like J5o isnt folding when they hit their J. And nothing worse is really calling you besides maybe A7. Also, when the board is dry we generally want to bet closer to 13 or 12 pot, especially with it being this multiway. Your assumptions about people always 3 betting AA and QQ arent true for low stakes live, plenty of people flat so its extremely possible people have overpairs. And because this board is so dry thered be no reason to raise two pair or a set, youd rather keep people in the pot when its this multiway, no need to scare them out if someone had a set and no need to get protection.  CO could also easily have J7 suited or a set, a set wouldnt always raise on the turn because if CO has any clue he would figure out you probably werent on a draw on the flop, like the hands that pick up outs arent raised pre and then bet on the flop. So CO isnt only going to call the 150 with weak Js. And yeah BTN is forced to call which is obviously bad.  River is fine, most people are calling flush draws with two overs and a gutter on the turn, V somehow played the hand just as badly as you did which is really saying something... did you ever figure out what BTN had  TLDR you need to study up on how people play in live poker and reevaluate most of your poker logic, also figure out whether you want worse to call or better to fold when youre betting, generally never bluff multiway in live low stakes poker.", "Preflop is fine.

Another card thats bad for you.   River, if you have an overpair, you should be now be scared because the flush gets there and there are 4 to the straight. If you check, these hands will probably bet for value. I think anything worse checks back. If you bet small, you can probably get called by worse Jx, sets or a chop, maybe even a better straight. Youd get raised by the flush, I dont know how many bluffs there are here maybe some Jx, but a lot of other bluffs are now 2pair hands so you could just betfold.

There will never be a demand high enough for solver play. Poker, like many wager based PvP games, consists of player pools from the hyper competitive to the degenerate gambler.   There are similar systems to solvers for every game out there and the reality is people are rarely disciplined or intelligent enough to handle these systems in meaningful ways.   The average result of solver principles spreading to the public is either going to be neutral or negative.   People are generally dumb as shit and highly confident in their abilities despite constant negative results. You add gambling habits to a subject and its infinitely worse.   Theres a million solutions for chess positions and all are free and auto installed into every single app with comprehensive review and analysis. The average skill is still garbage tier.   We have solvers for League of Legends and 65 of all players fail at moving forward in a straight line and acknowledging a mini map.

This machine would be capable of dealing the hole cards, face down, to players, while also displaying the flop, turn, and river face up. The number of players would be selected by pressing arrows on the machine, which will have a display, and the angles at which the players are sitting at would be user defined. As in, a memory location could be manually stores by turning the device on its rotating base towards a player, pressing the memory button, and then moving it to the next player and pressing the memory button, so on and so forth. How it would work is divided into a few parts  Shuffling The Poker Dealer would use a card bank system where a motor ejects the entire deck one card at a time in 52 random card banks. Currently, we are debating whether or not to use a method of pile shuffling 12 card banks which the machine randomly allocates cards to. We were wondering what you, the rpoker community, think of having cards randomly sorted in 12 banks at the start of the game and have the top card of each bank dispensed randomly by an algorithm. Do you feel like that level of randomness would be too low for your high stakes home game tournament   Dealing The poker dealer machine would also be able to swivel 270 degrees, allowing it to dispense cards in all directions, this allows it to deal a card to a player no matter where they are sitting. Another thing to mention is that during memory allocation, the individual operating the dealer machine must also select a dispenser speed 1 to 5 so that the card can be dispensed right next to the players stack. The diagram attached will visually explain better than my words. Community cards can be dealt face up to using the other side of the machine.   Initiating the next roundshands Once the blinds have been bey and all the preflop action is complete, the player sitting nearest to the machine can push the flop button to deal out the first 3 community cards. Then once all the action is complete, the turn button is pressed, and so on and so forth until the river button is pressed and a winner is determined. Players muck their hand and toss it to the player closest to the dealer robot, and heshe can just drop all the cards face down to the top, where the machine sorts each card back to a random slot out of 52 which is empty detected by sensors.  Note All cards are dealt to players by using a random integer algorithm where a random number from 152 which bank will be ejected is chosen.", "But who will I blame for being card dead", "Your shuffling method is confusing, wouldnt it be possible for 2 of the same card to come out when shuffling in banks Or is there some form of protection against that or am i dumb and misinterpreting this  Nvm, i am dumb.

How do you handle different felts on the table  Some felts are going to be smoother and the cards will go flying while other felts might have rough or sticky spots causing the cards to halt long before they make it to the player.  the player sitting nearest to the machine can push the flop button to deal out the first 3 community cards.

If the deck is warped, I do not think it will affect a motors ability to dispense the cards. If it does end up being a problem, we will find out as we prototype and test with different decks.   If the player pressed it too early, heshe is just an idiot at that point, or just made a mistake. Nothing really can be done at that point. Perhaps the player should ask the table if theyre ready for the next card   If the player closest to the dealer viewed the mucked cards, this could be avoided by all players keeping their mucked cards towards one corner or area of the table for each hand. That way it is unknowable.   To address all your main concerns, this dealer robot leaves all the math to the players at the table, as this is targeted at players with Homegame set ups. There would obviously be no rake at a homegame, at least legally speaking.   Just to clarify, this product is in no way trying to replace dealers on a casino grade.

There would be 3 burned cards dispensed, respectively during flop, turn, and river, face down at the end of each hand, assuming the players make it to the river. This allows casual home game players to check what could have come if they looked at the burned cards.", "Hi sorry, not sure if this was satire or not, but Im happy to help clarify any concerns. Essentially the brushed membrane is just a wall of fibre which an actuator can push through. The weight of the cards themselves dont push aside the brushes and allow the to split into the machine if the card was perpendicular to the ground while in the wheels banks, it could slip in towards the servo motor.

I knew what I had to do to give myself the best chance to win and deviating from that would cause me to lose.  Stuck to the game plan and won 1100 in that session.  Won my next 4 sessions and was up 3 gs for the week.    Yesterday I played with the carelessness of someone who thinks they know it all and lost 900.  I stepped back and was like okay We have to go back to the humble version of myself and play that way to continue having sucess.  Decided that if I cant play to the best of my ability tonight its  time for a break.  Bought 400 in chips at the cage and put 300 in my bag and 100 on the table.  Started off hot and was up 200 in 5 minutes.  Then went card dead or got playable hands and whiffed or got bad rivers 300 went down to 140.  Didnt get frustrated and patiently waited for good spots.  Won 60 here, won 100 there and won 120 there and my stack was up to 440.  Went card dead again and started feeling sleepy so I racked up and left up 340.  Didnt get into any cold deck scenarios or run hot or anything I just made my value bet sizes with lots of thought and got max value on all my winning hands.

I hate asking questions on some thing that a Google search should find me, but Im just not finding it. What would you recommend for some really good video, audio, or text strategy guides Im learning a lot I just playing and paying attention, but dont mind looking for some good help.  Second, when theres less than nine people, so usually, they play with five hole cards. Theres exactly enough cards to do this with eight people with 4 cards remaining after the river. The intention seems to be for this to be a splashy game, bluffs dont work, 5 or more see every raised flop and theres usually 3 or 4 at showdown. How much does five versus four hole cards really screw with trying to have some sort of strategy How would you adjust your game for this", "The strategy for all O8 games is the same.  Play hands that are A2xx and youll be very profitable.", "Any split pot game the first rule is to always be scooping. You have to play hands that work both ways. For instance a lot of people bomb money in the pot with naked A2. As its the best possible starting hand to win low. In a game like Omaha 8 though the low hand is only possible about 60 of the time. Which means 40 of hands are scooped by high hand. So you can exploit this by playing traditional Omaha high hands aggressively pre flop as well. These are also easier to get away from when they dont hit.   Dont chase 2nd low. So for instance dont keep putting money in with A3. Get out if a deuce doesnt hit flop or you dont have other options like flushes or high hands. Your best bet with low hands is to have multiple ways to win. Ideally a suited Ace, or wheel draw. A3 is a questionable hand. But A34K is pretty strong. Because you have multiple low cards and a high draw.   I saw a guide once with a point system for starting hands.  A2  20 A3  15  Any additional cards 6 or under add 3 points  Suited ace add 7 points  K or Q add 3 points.  Etc.  And the goal was to have 20 points before you would involve yourself in a hand. So you definitely play naked A2. 20 points. But you can see where A34K double suited would be a monster.   Finally with 5 hole cards assume the winning hand will be the nuts. Only play past the flop with the nuts or a draw to the nuts. Keep in mind my rule of the possibility of scooping. If you have no chance to scoop get out early during the cheaper streets.", "Call everything all the way down to showdown and let the dealer figure it out.", "Theres not a lot out there on HiLo strategy. I hate recommending something I havent read but I Greg Vail probably has the best HiLo books outs. Its probably worth mentioning the bar is not high. The major training sites are not interested in doing anything with HiLo.   CardQuant is the only one I know going any real modern analysis on the game. He has some stuff on his site thats good but not a lot. He is also very selective on who he takes in.   I think your last comment is referencing PLO8 vs BigO.  Personally I think 5Card is much better suited for HiLo than 4Card. The extra card really opens up the game a lot and really allows you to play a lot of powerhouse two way hands. If played correctly you should be able to scoop, quarter, and free roll players at a significantly higher frequency in BigO than you can in PLO8.  Its also worth mentioning that HiLo formats are probably the least stuffed of Omaha. They present a significant opportunity for profit when you can find them.", "Do not play hands without an Ace", "5 hole cards probably means.....if you dont have the nuts you dont win.  If theres 3 clubs on the board.....someone will have ace high flush. Almost every time. If you have Q high flush  you might as well fold. You are not winning.

Show off  You can probably count, too.   Yeah, Im envious.   Anyway, to answer your questions  1. There it not much good o8 material online or in books. The best you can find is probably Greg Vails Scoop series, but his recommendations are incredibly tight. If you play like he suggests in your home game, you will be bored and probably uninvited. His books are a good baseline strategy, though.   2. Five card versus four card changes strategy in two related ways. First, the marginal hands are stronger in five card than four. Second, redraws are much more important in 5 card versus 4 card,  even though redraws are important in both.   3. There is a strategy. I will outline hands you want to play below. The starting hands arent that much different in 5 card versus 4 card especially in loose games, but how you value your hand after the flop will change, with 5 card having higher requirements.   Starting hands aace, wnonace wheel, bbroadway a 6 plays like a wheel card when combined with another nonace wheel card   awwwb   awwbb   awbbb   wwwwx   9s are absolute trash to have in your hand, so you need really good side cards to compensate. 8s and 7s are almost as bad, but they can have value when combined with a nut low draw andor when they are the same suit as your ace.    you want to be suited, ideally double suited, ideally suited to the ace. Higher suited cards are more valuable than lower suited cards, but suited aces are off the charts valuable. Specifically, nonnut flushes are basically passive hands since the suited ace is more common. All that said, some players only bet the ace high flush, so you can fold any nonnut flush to them. Only you know if these players are in your game.    pairs are ok in the above hands, but they need to be broadway to have value. Set over set happens a lot, and you dont want to be on the bottom.    in 5 card, a flopped nut straight with no redraws is not a ram and jam hand, while it might be in some 4card games.    that said, in 5 card, nld plus nfd is a ram and jam hand, and even more so if you have a set or 2pr with it. Figure out what combo draws are plus ev in your game.    in loose 5 card games, you can play naked lows with protection and a backdoor draw or two with aggression. Basically you are freerolling your backdoor draws and you may take the full low half if you hit one of your protection cards. This is sort of an advanced play, and it helps if you know the equities.    check out various situations with propokertools. The best spots are when you are freerolling or when you have a chance to freeroll e.g., low with protection in a 4way or more pot.    the biggest mistakes that people make in 5card is overvaluing made hands with no redraws.

So I have no opinion or position on the matter as I have no clue who either person is.

She has a Jack of Club high but has nothing but Garrett has the potential for a straight or straight flush from his perspective but still has nothing when he goes allin.  Why is it normal for him to go allin with nothing but its crazy when she has the higher card  Sure, he has the potential for a straight or straight flush but he doesnt know if shes sitting on a pair of 10s or a 10 and 9 at that point, right  With the percentages being relatively close, from the TV viewers perspective, isnt that a reasonable risk  Isnt taking risks and bluffing or calling a bluff part of the game  Thanks  Update   Awesome  I appreciate everyone explaining the mechanics of that round and the thought processes from each players perspective  I learned quite a bit from everyones comments.", "Pokers an easy game when you can see everyones hole cards.", "No right minded player could ever expect to win that hand, or any hand really, with jack high.  In this case jack high is the 6th worst possible hand, beating only 8 high, 7 high, 6 high, 5 high and 4 high. Because of the way the hand was played, its pretty much impossible for Garrett to have 6 high, 5 high or 4 high, so there are being generous because hes very unlikely to be playing with a 7 high hand as well two hands that he might have that she can beat.  Meanwhile, there are lots of hands he might have that she loses to ace high, king high, queen high, any pocket pair, any 3, any 9 and any 10. Plus, when the final card is dealt she can only improve to a pair at best, but there are two flush draws and a straight draw that can hit for Garrett that blow her hand out of the water if he is playing the 7 high or 8 high hands. Even if she hits a jack that makes a pair for her, that completes the straight which would beat her pair. From her perspective if she isnt cheating there are very few combinations of his cards and the final card that dont beat her, and loads that do.  So she basically has to know exactly what cards Garrett is holding to make the call. With all the possibilities of what Garrett might be holding its impossible for even the best, smartest or most intuitive poker players in the world to be able to put Garrett on an 8 high or 7 high hand with any degree of confidence. They would consider the possibility, but wouldnt be able to pinpoint those hands as being any more likely than the rest, let alone have the confidence that the final card isnt going to complete those hands.  Its either stupid, crazy or cheating to play that hand the way she did. The percentages displayed are misleading, a reasonable player in that position would estimate their chance of winning the hand as 0 or maybe 5 because theres so many hands that they lose to and only a very small chance that Garrett is holding one of the few hands they can beat, and that theyll still beat that hand after the last card is dealt.", "In high level poker play, they dont just think he is probably bluffing, they think if hes bluffing, here are the probabilities that his bluff consists of the following pairs of cards  and then in their head is an associated probability for each pair of cards. So for example, if hes bluffing, a 10 chance hes bluffing with ace high, 5 chance hes bluffing with king high and so on.  In this situation, even if he was bluffing, the chance that he was bluffing witih 8c9c was extremely low, AND practically any pair there was a realistic chance he was bluffing with was beating her jack high.  Moreover, as you notedd, he had many draws, meaning even if she had a read that he had 89, its still not an obvious call, depending on how much money is in the pot etc.", "Its as simple as this  if garrett has a strong hand in this case then she loses like everytime.  if garrett is bluffing she still could be losing most the time.  so why would you call lol when half the time you are crushed and half the time you probably still lose.", "You have to consider that she called a bet that was for the rest of her stack. It was also a reraise against her raise on the turn. Facing this type of aggression makes it very unlikely J4high is ahead, even of most bluffs. Outside of that, there isnt much strategy to discuss. The hand was played outside of any known strategy which is why the commentator was so surprised. Thats why she either had a read, got lucky, cheated, or is a top 5 cash player in the country.", "In the history of poker  no one makes that call. Ever   And shes very bright and had a Coach. Her call  as the young kids say  is not a thing", "The reason why its crazy is she is  1. Stone dead 0 chance of winning on the river vs any hand hes doing this with for value  2. Almost stone dead against any conceivable bluff he would use in this specific spot, other than specifically 87 and 76 of clubs which she only has 50 against. Any higher straight draw, and any higher flush draw, she has only 612 equity at best.  So even if she knew he was bluffing somehow, with 100 certainty, its still a call equivalent to burning money since it is crushed by the vast majority of his bluffs", "Even most hands he would be bluffing with in that spot would likely have her beat. While he technically has the worst hand hes got a draw to a lot of very good hands including the nuts. Shoving will very likely get your opponent to fold a lot of bs hands, like ace high. And even if she does have a hand hes got a lot of equitychance of making a hand and is never drawing dead in that spot.  Im not saying she cheated, but that was a pretty bafflingly dumb call. Which is why it shocked everyone. In fact it was so dumb it makes me think its really unlikely that there was any cheating because its essentially a coin toss and looks super suspicious. If youre gonna cheat by getting tipped off what your opponents cards are you could do so with much better odds in your favor in situations where it would make much more sense for you to get it in.", "53 47 is only if you know who has what.  Most of his hands should be crushing her.  She only knows that she has pot odds if she is cheating", "Its just so improbable that even if garret is bluffing that robbi is ahead. Like maybe 1. The vast majority of his bluffs beat J high. Such as QJ which makes J4 only an 8 chance to win. The fact that robbi had the Jack of clubs also makes it less likely that Garret is bluffing because thats an important card to have a straight or flush draw. Since robbi has it garret cant have draws containing that card making his holdings more weighted toward a value hand which she would be drawing dead to  If she called with J4 of clubs nobody would have batted an eye or even J8 without clubs. It would have been a bad gamble but at least a sensible one.  Even if she called with KJ or KQ it wouldnt have been that crazy.", "I see you got some responses, but I just wanted to add          Why is it normal for him to go allin with nothing but its crazy when she has the higher card   To bluff. When he goes all in, she has to call or fold. He wants her to fold. He basically does not want to go to showdown. Then comes her turn, and she has to call or fold. So that means either     A. They go to showdown which she definitely doesnt want to happen if she doesnt know his hand.Call   B. She loses only a small amount compared to what she would lose to an all in.     Lets say Garrett had 4 of diamonds and 6 of diamonds instead of what he has in the video. Basically whoever goes allin first will most likely win the hand because both hands are complete garbage and neither of them want to go to showdown and an all in forces showdown or for you to give up.     Sorry if you already knew this, but from the way you stated this question, I just wanted to add this, just in case.", "So I went and watched this hand and a couple of things stand out to me.  Could she be cheating.....always possible.  I can also see her doing something like this with Jack6 of clubs. That play would make a lot of sense and here is why  During the hand, one of the commentators said that with big Combo draws Garrett usually pushes. When he pushed here that is exactly what she might have put him on....a big combo draw. Ofcourse I had to rewatch the hand twice because her tits are so nice.  Any way, if she has a dead read on him that it is exactly the hand he has, then calling here with a jack6 club hand would be a fully justifiable play.  Calling just with a jack blocker and a 4 which is irrelevant is deff weird and fishy. But Ive seen people call with q10 on a 5 3 8 board so there", "Yes, there were 2 people playing poker, 1 cheated, the other got mad.", "Hey, Ive read this thread and cant count the number of inaccuracies the responders have made.  They are a victim of GTO fallacies and subconsciously misogynist.  The whole its either cheating or stupid canard is simply disallowing the truth that an intermediate woman made a soul read and a hero call against a supposed expert male player.  Done arguing with these idiots. Robbi is neither a cheater nor an idiot. Shes a great player. She made a gutsy call despite knowing that she could be getting it in bad.  None of these geniuses have surmised that Robbi may have accidentally seen Andys Ten that he folded and applied that knowledge to Garretts disadvantage.  Which would explain some of the bizarre things that happened afterwards, like her returning Garrett the money she won.  Theyll avoid it even if they are aware of it, bc theyll use two sets of ethics against her... one for females, the other for males. Its a gray area as to what she should have done if she did see that card.  And Eric Persson also talked in the hand and easily could have influenced her in her decisionmaking, but almost nobody called Eric a cheater and demanded to see his phone records, let alone discuss the fact in the first place.  Poker is full of onlineplaying incels who have no clue about the realities of a live cash game dynamic.  Your confusion about why everybody is upset is warranted. Theyve been on a delusional witchhunt ever since Garrett asked her to explain herself and immediately interrupted her and dismissed her when she attempted to respond. Go watch the tape again.  Hes an arrogant jerk who accused an innocent woman and others of cheating at cards, and went on a characterassassinating smear campaign when there wasnt any proof to his wild claim.", "Yeah, you reraise from the straddle...  When you cant see everyones hole cards you get hands like this.", "Thanks for the very indepth answer.  I responded to another commenter and it was kinda on the same lines.  He had something if he drew one of 14 cards whereas she had something if she drew only one of 6 cards.  But your answer explained about the possible scenarios, much appreciated", "I see  Thanks for explaining how they would have processed the situation in their head.  I dont play, I only have a basic understanding of the rules of the game but not any strategies.", "Perfectly put.", "It depends on how youre playing the hand.  Youre about a coinflip if youve decided preflop that youre all in, no matter which cards are dealt. Maybe even better than a coinflip against LAG. Face card alone might give you 60.  Remember, shes called down the last 910 hands against him and knows he makes plays with garbage hands. And that 1 fold was the last hand. Id probably be thinking at this point he cant always have it if hes playing so many hands.  But yeah if you are playing with proper decision making, yeah its a bad play. But then again, playing with j4, one of the worst combos in the game, in the first place is a bad decision. You dont play this kind of hand unless youve already decided youre all in or folding to almost everything.", "Not true.", "Ok, cool.  So for Garrett, even though he didnt have anything at that point, it was considered a strong hand because, statistically speaking from his perspective, it was possible for him to either get a straight flush, straight or a pair with the last dealer card   There would be 14 cards that could be drawn to give him one of those combinations.     Whereas for Robbi, it was weak because the best hand she could get was a pair of Jacks or 4s  In that case, there would be only 6 cards that would give her that.  Is that how a poker player would have processed the situation, based on only their cards and the dealers cards", "Even if you have a read that its bluff its still a fold almost all the time. Theres not even many hands in his bluffing range that she beats", "The last option you mentioned is not a real option. The top 5 in the country dont make that call ever", "And shes very bright    I would not go that far", "Intimation was cheating", "Shes putting him on a draw, not value. You havent watched Garrett enough, his overbet shoves are polarized to air more than you seem to want to believe. Meaning, hes looking for the fold more than the call, especially against females and recs.", "I appreciate your input  From my nonplayer perspective, I dont know the established norns in poker.  While I understand the idea of the bluff appear to have something that yoi dont have, its a bit counterintuitive given the cards dealt.  For example, if I was Garrett, how do I know that Robbi doesnt have a 10 instead of a J or 4  Id be risking my potential hands against the possibility that she has a 3 of a kind or a full house.  In other words, I would have thought a bluff would occur to obscure a strong hand rather than risk it all with nothing.  He put in all of his chips despite having nothing, he lost, he got mad and so Im thinking But you had nothing when you went all in  Why should you be mad that the bluff didnt work  And your explanation and the others are helping me understand what I initially missed.", "I was poking light fun at OP. I wasnt saying Robbi could see hole cards. Although, I get why one would presume that.", "Youre a kind OP. We appreciate you.", "To put it even more simply calling with jack high loses to almost every bluff in this situation.", "Another way to think about this is that in poker, betting and calling may look similar they both require putting chips in the pot. But when you bet you have two ways to win the hand  you end up with the best hand OR the other person folds. When you call, you dont win unless you have the best hand. So relative hand strength isnt the only factor.", "Pretty much. Keeping in mind these players are not necessarily thinking i need to hit xyz to make this hand and win. Theyre just figuring out how they can win the hand, which is usually to outmaneuver the players with aggression.   He was on two draws with decent equity, which is favorable for when we want to bluff. His perceived hand strength was also in his favor. With the action playing out, we can not easily rule out a full house pocket 9s AceTen, T9, etc. Even an acehigh call in this spot would be legendary, and it would have been talked about.", "it was considered a strong hand because  Its not even really that because his hand was very weak but with the potential to become strong.  In Garretts case, he had a good chance to improve which is the type of hand you generally want to bluff with but more importantly his read on Robbi was that she was very weak which was correct.  On Robbis end, it was a terrible call because like other people have said, even Garrets bluffs were all stronger than Robbis hand except literally the exact hand he was holding.    And even if Robbi had a read, correctly put Garret on a bluff and even if Robbi had made her hand she was still likely to be holding the losing hand based on the board.   Going all in with nothing happens all the time and is basically required at times if you want to win more than lose.  Its almost always better to be the one going all in than it is to be the one calling the all in unless your hand is the nuts best possible hand on a given board or close to it.", "Lol. She was beating the exact hand he held, and did, on both runouts. GTFOH.", "Youre right. It was a joke.", "Yeah. She dumb.", "deleted", "You dont know Robbi doesnt have a 10 instead of a J or 4. Its still a gamble but he has an idea because of the way the hand was played. Hes not angry that she has a higher card or that the bluff is not working. If you watch it again, the moment she says she calls, hes still smiling even though he knows hes behind cause otherwise she wouldnt call. The moment she shows her terrible cards, he gets angry and suspicious. Hes even smiling when both the runouts brick and hes 99.99999 sure he lost.", "I appreciate the kind responses for my first poker post.  With all of the cheating hitting the news e.g. chess, fishing, even ballet apparently, I know that sometimes emotions can run high and people can pick sides.  Zero snark here, just a ton of insight and perspective being shared.", "This is the main point", "Nah even cheating here is dumb", "I see  Ok, now the commentators responses make more sense with your breakdown and others.  I will watch the clip again for Garretts reactions, I did not pick up on any of that nuance.", "And this isnt a true statement.

I used to play stars way back when online poker was legal across US many moons ago, and what I can tell you is ignitionbovada feels and plays more like a live game.

It would be a better prep before playing live imo than any other site.", "this a good service", "what state", "I fully agree with your comment, but Im of the unpopular opinion that all poker sites should allow for chat, and not just the preselected options.   Chatting allows you to randomly spice up the game after a long cash game session is getting dry. It allows you to needle someone part of poker to punt you their stack when they otherwise wouldnt have. It may also be used to loosen up an otherwise tight table. I know ive logged on drunk and punted a stack or two while chatting like a maniac.  As for why they dont allow it, I assume its to prevent people from saying what they have pre or something. But they could easily make rules in the code to prevent anyone not in a pot from saying anything.

Without it, it does take away some aspect of what is part of any competitive game. I am sure removing an open chat was another extension of their efforts to prevent potential collusion in the game and obviously a good way to further protect themselves from liability. That said, no game is foolproof. It isnt impossible for two or more players to keep exiting and entering a game on bovadaignition until at least 2 make it into the same table and share information on the side. I certainly have been in a few questionable 12 games with max buyin players late late night US time where alot of questionable squeezing and mutli flatting among the same seats is out of the norm, especially at showdown. One of the other things that stands out is when nonstandard betsizing is virtually idientical in multiple seats.

Which is literally going to be this one time.  I certainly wouldnt come to a poker sub and setup shop with captain fish bravado.  Even as a gamble its bad, youre not getting a particularly good return on the risk. You get better returns on avg trading quarters for nickels.    I think vs 3 callers without looking at hrc, pretty sure you have somewhere in the vicinity of 3.86 equity vs presumed calling ranges, with some removal,   even less if you loosen the calling ranges up a bit. And that  bluff  is never getting folds from 55 in small stakes to that kind of action  so were having like zero fold equity   getting called by a lot of hands  3 this time  after the shove as well, so how this is even considered a gamble", "True. Am too autistic to realize", "They get a better price because they already put in money. Probably not that relevant when the straddle is so much larger than the BB, but if it was 2510 BB would almost certainly have a limping range.  Also, when UTG raises in a normal game, theyre somewhat likely to play in position post flop, whereas SBBB will always be OOP here and BTN is not likely to fold much.", "Dont know the answer but my guess is that, SB and BB will be out of position if it gets folded around which is why playing a smaller pot is better while UTG and UTG1 will be in position if it gets folded to the blinds.", "Very good question, Id probably be able to answer better if I had a Monker saved run of a BTN straddle but Ive only seen them, not run them myself.  My take Blinds get a good price on a limp since they already have money dead, meaning they should take advantage of this by having a polar limping range premiums plus weaker fringe hands which allows them to play a bit wider, because the weaker hands are protected.  The main reason that UTG and UTG1 dont limp in full ring is rake, if you run sims with no rake that allow limps, youll see the EV of limping from EP is very very close to the EV of open raising, but the fact that you have no money already in the pot and you pretty rarely, but occasionally win the blinds pre by raising gives open raising slightly higher EV.   This means that in practice, if people play badlymake mistakes vs. limps preflop, you may actually be better off having a limping range from EP, particularly if you play a pretty snug 79 of hands and limp raise like fuck.", "This is rpoker, his comment is indicative of the average ego around here", "No", "Maybe the guy was just having fun in an action game", "Dude stfu", "I have played with a few people who could play at these stakes with that kind of action like it was nickles and pennies.

Im no pro but that doesnt mean I dont study the game and learn every chance I get", "My reasoning for challenging the theory of peeps dont bluff enough at the low stakes so just over fold is because Ive heard so many times on poker podcasts by legitimate pros that the most profitable poker style is by playing exploitative.  Yes against the average recreational low stakes player fold to late street bets like your life depends on it this in a sense is an exploit like folding top pair top kicker to a recs check raise all in on river, in some spots the math maybe right to call etc.  but you know someone like this is never doing this with less than 2 pair while ur holding 1 pair.  And to exploit this in the opposite way is to be willing to hero call against special players who exploit the player pool themselves by over lifting rivers depending on the GTO theory of small stakers never bluff so he takes advantage of this by bluffing cuz alota players dont got the balls to call him down following this theory.  So we exploit these kinda guys by keeping it in mind that this one is very capable of overbet bluffing rivers.  Ive won pots that in GTO should be medium sized pots without risking too much for example calling a nearly 2x pot sized river bet with 3rd pair so instead of losing 40 by waving the white flag, I take a stand and make a ballsy call risking a significant portion of my stack based on the fact that this guy is capable of making this move and the line hes taken just doesnt feel right and because this guy bluffs so often, its a profitable exploit to make these hero calls.  So instead of being down 40 following normal strats, we can be up 300 from a hand where we had 2 over cards to our pair.  Obviously these crazy guys will have it sometimes and well be wrong but because they bluff so often, its not wrong to make crazy calls.  Hope you get what I mean", "Thats what I noticed about his game.  I never see him cash out for more than 600.  I think the biggest stack Ive seen him with is 700 and that was at the juiciest table where people were calling down their entire stacks with 2nd pair.  Ive only seen him walk out with nothing like 12 times over the many years weve played amongst eachother", "Definitely bet bet bet is super strong 99 of the time but u reminded me of this game I was in one time where this kid and his buddy were constantly bet bet shoving and getting folds then looking at eachother and giggling.  Took this line way too many times to have it everytime, I tangle with this kid headsup on the button with AQ off and raised to 25, kid down bets flop, over bets turn, and shoves river.  I had nothing but ace high the whole time.  I decided after calling turn im snapping off everything cuz no way this  kid hit this board.  Suprise suprise he snap shoves river and I snap him off and wait for him to roll it over.  He says youre good. I continue to wait for him to roll it over cuz Im not showing A high then to have him roll over bottom pair, he finally mucks and I just show him that I called him down with ace high in a 700 pot so that hed be a little more hesitant to put me in tough spots.  Him and his buddy literally lost their shit screaming HOW DO YOU CALL WITH ACE HIGH TH ENTIRE WAY.  A magician never spills his secrets so I look at them and just wink.  Both of them seemed very deflated after that hand and the kid I hero called said Im not playing against this guy right now. His buddy says give me a chance I still got chips.  Buddy with chips ends up racking up after 5 or so minutes and the table breaks.    Im not saying calling down like this is profitable but its the only time Ive ever called down a bet bet shove line with just a high card but I followed my gut and was right.  I think its important to be able to identify bluffy lines when in position.  Lets say theres a dry flop that checks around, turn is a complete brick and a wildman bets 1.5x pot then when the river comes out another complete brick this guy bet 175 into 95 and I had 10s on an A Q high board and he showed down 8 high.  This kinda goes back to what the legendary omc said to me what game is the table playing. And to even extend that poker thought Id what game does this certain player think Im playing and how could he exploit the game he perceives me playing. Not advocating for hero calling unless you have a very good reason to and if those reasons outweigh just fold to heavy aggression on later streeets then go with your gut.  Youd be surprised just how often your instincts are correct sometimes.  Id say I feel this instinct about 2 outa every 5 sessions, Ill follow it one outA those 2 times.

What about the spots where the solver splits its range linearly All combos in the range check and bet at a frequency of 3070. In particular I noticed these solutions when looking at BB leading ranges on certain textures.  What would be an advisable approach in these spots Range betsrange checks fine RNG 50 bet check every combo in range fine Try to deduce some sort of polar strategy by looking at the differences between 30 combos and 70 combos Please let me know your opinion or whats the general consensus in the community nowadays.", "Look at the EV difference between betting and checking. If they are  the same, the solver is mixing for deception and you can bet or check in those spots based on opponent tendencies or table dynamics. Its not going to affect your EV much either way. If one is clearly higher EV for a given hand, identify which hand class that is and make a note of it. Do the same for when checks are higher EV. Go through the whole range like this and you will have created a simpler polarized strategy that doesnt sacrifice too much EV.

Its value comes from how in 3bet and 4bet pots the ranges are much more defined.  On T,J,Q high dry flops, AK thats a different suit to the TJQ is the best triple barrel hand, blocking KJKTKQATsAJs. Ppl should rarely be bluffing the offsuit combos of those hands so youre blocking their best TPTK hands.  Same for paired T, J, Q flops.  When youre cbetting small, a lot of value comes from how Ace and King high with back door flushs need to float. So when you have that suits in your hand, they will fold more often, as they have less floats. So AsKh on 9s6h3d is still a great cbet.  On gutshot boards, if the 2 broadway cards are different suits, theres less two pair combos, and theyre more likely to have top or middle pair. So you can use that to bluff more. AK thrives on people only calling 3bets preflop with QTs, JTs, QJs, not QToJToQJo. So you can be more willing to bluff when this is the case.  AK is a great bluff hand for flush runouts blocking the nut flush.  The skills that come together to make AK profitable and easy to play  planning out the bet sizes. You can work backward from what you want to bet on the river, to know what to bet on the flop or turn. If you cbet flop in a 3bet pot 13rd, then size up on turn, you generally will have around a 23rd pot or full pot river shove.  This means you should be bluffing 2933 of the time. So you have a 2to1 value to bluff ratio.  If the board itself blocks a lot of flushes, you may only have 6 credible flush combos. You should only be bluffing the nut flush blocker 13rd of the time you have AKo with either the ace or king of that suit.  Because you have 6 AKo combos with either the ace or king of that suit, your bluff frequency would be 4050, if you always made that bluff repping the flush. Thats overbluffing and youll be called too often.

Were 6handed.  The table is very fishy, apart from UTG. I have tagged UTG as a nitty TAG. I see them playing allday, multitabling and have plenty of tabletime with them.   UTG opens to 3BBs. Immediately I know this is strong i.e. probably slightly tighter than what is technically correct from UTG 6handed.  The rest of the table, including the SB, all flatcall. Terrible, I know, this is why I play on this site  So, what would be the correct play here with JJ in the BB The pot is now 16BBs. Its 2BBs for me to call.  However...I dont see how I can call in this spot JJ is going to be impossible to play postflop mutliway against 5opponents.  So for me, its raise or fold. JJ feels too good ro fold in this particular spot and the raise size is tricky. If I go too small, Ill get 5callers and will be back in a terrible spot. If I go 3x pot from the BB, I am virtually potcommitted by the flop anyway.  I realise that UTG is really the only player that canshould call a raise here. They should be the only player with AA, KK, QQ or AK. The rest have capped there range by flatting....so I shove allin for 90BBs  I wont post the result...but I wanted to ask...whats the correct play here  Feels dirty to shove so many BBs with JJ in a cash game...but felt like the right play in that particular spot", "I would squeeze to 18bb then fold vs UTG and happily snap call against anyone else.

After that it depends on your flop. With low cards, easy cbet. With cards like A  K or Q you might want to check fold. You would then lose only 27bb and not your whole stack.

I think ultimately at these stakes and with this skilllevel, as soon as the pot goes multiway and the stacks are relatively shallow, all the money is going in whether a player has a hand or not. Its not uncommon to see someone miss, blastoff and get calledraised. I have seen many a time two players get into an allin situation on the flop with no pair and only backdoor draws  My usual tactic is to avoid multiway pots at all costs because they become wild gambling at these stakes, so I generally bet whatever I need to bet pre to get it headsup.", "Yeah but theres 12BBs in dead money out there...surely that has to be factored in", "So I was the one who shoved. Going back to OP, I was in the BB with JJ and was facing an UTG 3x open and four flatcallers.  With 90BBs and 16BBs in the pot, I didnt want to raise to, say, 3x, because I knew I would get AT LEAST two callers, making the pot 63BBs going to the flop. With 63BBs in the middle and 72BBs remaining in my stack, I didnt feel comfortable that I had any room to manouvere postflop at all.   Now I type that, I can see I did have some...I could have folded to any overcard...but that means I have to fade a Q, K or A and could still endup running into sets or two pair.  My thinking behind the shove was that I had already compiled plenty of notes on UTG, the only other solid player at the table. I knew he was a TAGgy nit, so I knew his calling range was AA and KK for sure and probably, but not definitely, AK and QQ.   So my thinking was, big win for me if I can get him to fold something like KQs, QJs, AJ, AK, AQ etc...and then get called by one of the fish, who had capped their ranges, with a hand like 7s, 9s, 10s or just random junk  The result was UTG folded, UTG1 called bear inmind, with three players still to act and showed Q10o  Of course, the Q10o binked the flop...but I achieved what I had set out to achieve...got it in really good and maximised the equity of my hand.

I understand that the play is a raise in a game with skilled players, but in a good game with skilled players you dont get 4flat callers to an UTG raise.  A guy already confirmed shoving JJ in this spot is probably a  GTO play so I dont think its as clearcut as just do X.  The problem is with raising 34x is how you play the hand postflop.

I assume in the GTOwizard solution UTG is playing close to 4bet or fold right So JJ is mixing 4betshove and fold If thats the case then I think it can easily be extrapolated that TT and other hands that are just outside the continue range can get in the mix when theres an extra 2bb out there and every range is likely to be much wider than optimal.", "UTG on the tight side but probably opening all pairs because people do at microstakes, all suited broadways  some of the stronger offsuit broadways.

I tried to keep my focus to nobudget, lowbudget, and midbudget options, thinking if you got 1k3.5k to drop on material you likely have an idea about what you need.   RIOs vision is a good alternative to PLO Trainer, but I personally prefer the latter. I know some who prefer Vision and are happy with it.   I do highlight several other resources outside of PLOMM. With that said, the strength of PLOMM is their sole focus on PLO. I think it really shines through when comparing the other options.   Their free blog has a lot of articles and you get nothing but PLO content. Thats why I think its a good free reference. If I go to Upswings Blog I have to sift through articles to find PLO content. If RIO has free articles, Ive never found them navigating their site or searching search engines specifically for them.   Their focus on just PLO has allowed them to put out much more content and better options, imo, than other sites. Again, there is a lot to be said for focusing on one area vs many.   Interesting stance on JNandez. Personally, Ive never had a bad interaction with him or heard of anyone having bad interactions with him. Id be interested to hear why you think that though. Thanks for the comments.", "Yes, good point. I will put a note in the article.    I had a conversation with them a couple of weeks ago. I think much of the decision to not put resources towards it is driven by the tool not generating much profit. That conversation resulted in them dropping the price from 300 to 125.   I believe the original idea was the tool would serve two purposes. 1. It was a solid base to build on for a PLO Solver. 2. It would help generate funding to support that development.   I say all that to say that any project from a business standpoint is pursued on the idea it adds value to the business. Under the previous price, I dont think PLOCalc did. Hopefully under the new price it will. I cant speak for PioSolver so unsure what the future of PLOCalc will be.   I can say that at the current price with no support or updates, its a huge value in what you can do with it. I have been able to do a lot of things in the last two weeks that I have been unable to do with Odds Oracle. Additionally the ease at which Im able to do it is pretty nice.

Seems worth switching to PLOMM. 50mo cheaper as well  So, just some thoughts on that would be great. Ill pm you on the Jnandez and edit my comment above.", "Sorry for delay on reply. Got caught up with some stuff.  I wanted to give this a thoughtful detailed analysis and it ended up being a lot longer than I anticipated.   Here is the TLDR PLO Trainer Pro has more features that allow you to deeply analyze the game which I think is important in plo. Some of these are more solved spots, advanced syntax filtering, advanced bucketing of preflop and postflop hands for visualization and filtering, equity calculator, EV for every hand for all actions, and advanced postflop bucketing matrix.   Here is a little more detail on the TLDR.   PLO Trainer has a lot more effort put into interface that displays a lot of details. This really helps with digging deep into understanding. Vision seems to be missing a lot of that.   PLO Trainer has preflop solutions for stack sizes for 30bb, 50bb, 75bb, 100bb for games with rake structure for 50PLO, 200PLO, 500PLO and 5000PLO. 500PLO also has 150bb and 200bb solutions. There are also solutions for GGPoker Rake Structures for 10bb, 20bb, 30bb, 40bb, 50bb, 75bb, and 100bb stack sizes. These spots are solved for all preflop spots enabling you to look at very specific situations. You do not get this level of detail on the Vision solves.   This is one thing that I love. I am very details oriented and I am big into analyzing minor fluctuations in strategy to really understand what is happening as stack sizes and rake structures change. Where its a huge selling point to me, It might be overkill for some people.   Another noticeable feature is the level of detail you can look at in preflop hand categories. PLO trainer is broken down into nine major buckets with the ability to break down to over 70 subbuckets I think MM uses the term category. All of these give you a visual for raisefoldcall with frequency makeups to gauge not only how much of that category you are playing but how much if your entire range it makes up. Each of these can be selected as a filter. You can select multiple sub categories to get more specific groupings.   The other great feature is that you can use the PPT syntax with some additional filtering syntax built in to get very specific in filtering hands. If you are familiar with Odds Oracle, ProPokerTools Simulator, or MonkerSolver, this is very familiar. You can combine this with the bucket filtering listed above to get very specific.   The ability to use both syntax and bucket filtering gives you so much more flexibility than PLO Visions filtering capabilities. Talking to players who switch from Vision, this is a common point that is mentioned.   The next great feature you get is the ability to look at EV for individual hands and compare the EV difference of same hand between two different actions. This is huge in making exploitative adjustments where you might choose a different action if EV between a raise or a call or a raise or a fold are very close but game conditions make shift EVs differently.   As for postflop, PLO MM appears to be solving more spots and updating at a faster rate than RIO. The idea of bucketing hand  categories is carried over in PLO Trainer to postflop with advanced filtering syntax and EV displayed for every hand.   Vision does have a lot more turns than PLO Trainer however no rivers. PLO Trainer has rivers but less turns. You can run solves in Monker for both although PLO Vision is a little easier and quicker with the .ahk script. This feature does save much time in solving in Monker. At the end of the day its kind of a wash to me. Im greedy and would like all turns and rivers but thats not the current state of either.   Visions response response time is quicker than PLO trainer however, this seems to be due to PLO Trainer compiling a lot more data in a way that can be better used. There are also sone features Visions training function does have over PLO Trainer although trainer is working hard to close that gap. Much of their effort has gone into expanding the solution library.   PLO Vision does have aggregate board feature which lets you see data across a variety of flops at once. This is something the PLO Trainer Web App doesnt have. Its worth noting that everything Ive mentioned is comparing PLO Trainer Web App to Vision.   This is where I think the big line gets drawn. Vision is 200month and PLO Trainer Web App is 149month. I can get PLO Trainer Pro that adds the desktop trainer for 189month. The additional features you get with this are significantly better than Vision.   You get a similar board analysis that Vision has plus a builtin equity calculator that does range vs range comparison with an equity distribution graph.   Another great feature is the bucket matrix. This feature creates a matrix of all of your postflop hand categories in a way that allows you to start grouping characteristics together finding what type characteristics drive bets and checks more. Im probably describing it poorly but it really allows you to start grouping how all of your cards work together to start building equity and EV on top of your made hand you currently have.   You also get all the bucket visualization filtering features from the app but with better visualizations and user interface options. This is due to it being a desktop application.   I think both tools are good but I really like PLO Trainer due to the analysis strengths it gives you over Vision.   I believe PLO is something that takes a lot more analysis to develop understanding. In holdem we can memorize a lot of stuff that is impossible in plo due to the increase in combos.   This comes back to really needing to dig into things deeper and really understanding the small details to help you develop heuristics and pattern recognition that is founded in theoretical understanding.   Sorry this ended up being so long but wanted to give it a thoughtful analysis.", "Is playing with a balanced range necessary vs strangers", "People talk so much about playing GTO, and using theoretically balanced strategy to make it harder to play against   But surely thats only gonna be worth it if you play enough hands against a certain opponent for them to begin and try to figure out your range", "uh when you see someone for the first time and know nothing about them and their strategy they are a stranger   so the first hand you play with them what is the best strategy use a balanced gto strategy because you have no information on them and how to exploit them  so yes it is necessary to play close to gto versus strangers as a baseline until you have the information needed to exploit them  you obviously can use population tendencies to play a exploitative strategy vs unknown as a default, but this is assuming your Bayesian inference is strong and you know your population and sample well, otherwise its disasterous to assume everyone is a loose fish and play strangers like they are and run into a tight nit oopsies", "After watching negreanus videos on youtube about modern day poker, all i gotta say is that its an absolute joy to play this way after years and years of stress over feeling like I didnt have proper control over my game.

The heart of your post is that youre afraid hes going to figure out what you have and bluff you out with A5 or something.

Always happy for advice to improve my game especially from hostile knowitalls on reddit. Ive read the theory of Poker Sklansky and harrington on hold em and always looking for recomendations for good contemporary strategy books.  Last night I bought in to a 13 NL game in the Seattle area for 200 at a table where most stacks were 5001000. Yes I know first mistake buying in for any less than 100BB I should have for at least 500 but I didnt want to dip into babys shoe budget.  Anyway I was dealt in on the button and first hand dealt Ah Kd. 4 players ahead of me limp in lol and I raise to 15. BB, UTG, UTG2 call and we head 4 ways to the flop.  Flop comes Kh Qd 7h with 61 in the pot.  Table checks around to me and I bet 50. Big Blind raises 150 and it folds around to me for 135 all in effectively.  I tank for a minute and call. Turn comes Qs river 3d.   Big blind turns over Ks 7s. He flopped 2 pair and the queens counterfeited so I scooped the pot.  Did I make the wrong call and get lucky I know i had about 1.81 pot odds to call at the flop and figured the odds were good enough that even if I was a little behind with top pair top kicker I had enough equity with the possibility of hitting a backdoor flush, A, set of Kings. At the same time I suspected he had two pair or a set which would have been an instant fold, but there was a good enough chance he was trying to scare me off the pot with a lesser King.  Also I recognize I likely overbet the flop from my position and I should have checkedgone with maybe a 1413 pot size bet, which would have made folding easier on me.  Thanks for your feedback It was a friendly game but I didnt trust any feedback from people at the table because they definitely were the types to encourage poor playing.

Live 13 people are calling with any two, charge them for it. Your open should be something like 10  each limp, so 22 at least. Id go for 2530 to get it heads up.  Post flop you should probably call here, theres enough combos draws that I think this is profitable in the long run. Especially for 100 more, you are getting good odds to put it in here.   You can definitely hero fold if you have a read, this will be two pair of pocket 7s a good amount of time.  But even if its two pair, you still have solid odds for the board to pair especially because KQ isnt that likely due to the preflop action.", "Preflop is good.

A few weeks ago we were bored so decided to play a few hands again. I want to say upfront i have a card shuffler, and we were using it with two different decks back and forth.   First hand she throws back one card then stands pat both rounds while betting each chance, turns out she got dealt AAJJ and grabbed another J on first draw. Nice hit. Second hand she throws 3 back and ends up with QQJJx at the end, beating my 9977x two pair. Fair enough, no biggie. Third hand I get dealt 4 to a straight and draw one on the first round and make it She thinks for a moment then also draws one card again and then stands pat both betting rounds same as me. I get the impression that she knows Im strong, so shes decided not to throw any back either after seeing me do the same. On the river, I bet and she puts me all in, I snap call. Nope, another full boat, KK999 beats my straight.    This is when it gets nuts. Im dying laughing about her beginners luck and were divvying up the chips from her stacking me lol. I wash the cards on the table and then use the shuffling machine and cut. Fourth hand she only discards one card again She literally giggles to herself as I give her the card  Next round, she stands pat and then leads into me with a large overpot sized bet. I look her in the eye and say, if youre bluffing right now, this is the most brilliant bluff ever run. She smiles. I call. Next round, we both stand pat, she open bets everything, putting me all in. Im convinced she had nothing and is repeating the exact pattern as her full houses to fuck with me. And it works. I call with my straight and she says youre not gonna believe this and lays down AKQJT of hearts. She drew one card to the inside royal flush and came back with the Queen of Hearts exactly, lol. I took a photo of it, and promptly retired for the night    21 year of playing, including many years online 45 tables at once, Ive never had one.

It does not mean to do one exactly 80 of the time and the other exactly 20. Although, in the long run it should work out that way in this exact spot.  If you are confused about the difference between the call 3bet and 4bet themselves, you just have to realize that the aggressor and the defender respectively have access only to one of these options.

Eventually, the solver reaches a state known as the Nash equilibrium. That is what you see on your screen. The only time you should use these exact ranges in this exact way is if youre playing a perfect opponent which will never happen.   So you might then wonder, what the hell is the point of GTO Good question.   Rather than borrow the ranges a solver spits out, you should pay attention to the frequencies of action that the solver chooses. Not within individual hands, but the range overall. What percent of the range 3bets What percent of the range opens What percent of the range folds to a 4bet These ranges are the approximate average that you should use in a given spot. But more importantly, you should pay attention to how the solver composes its range with bluffs and value hands. if you take a note of the frequencies, the ratios, and the logic of the solver you will have gotten from it what it has to offer you. Dont make the mistake of playing GTO ranges.", "Uh we actually know this is a LJ 4 bet strategy,  so your first point is moot.

Yes you should 4 bet in certain instances. Stop being a slave to charts that literally give you a baseline idea of what hands you shouldshouldnt consider 4 betting.

To be more specific using the output the OP posted, the KJsK9s probably has a mix of flats and folds in addition to the 4bets.

The distribution determines the EV, not the other way around. It seems you are suggesting folding vs raising is the same EV. In a vacuum theyre not.

That isnt to say raising is the same EV as calling, but that raising at a specific frequency, assuming we conform to all the other GTO nodes, is highest EV.

Adding exploits aka solving for a different tree is of course going to have different resultse.g. raising 100 vs mixing.  Try taking the low frequency option every decision for a week straight. It wont go so well.  That said Im a washed up pro that hasnt studied in a few years, but I think my understanding of how a solver calculates EV is correct. I could be wrong though.

Im actively aware the strats which fall from MDA on player pool data usually go against GTO, but it doesnt matter, cause Im not interested in playing GTO, as its almost impossible to do. Rather, I study solver MDA to build up my GTO heuristics that I can apply at the table. Mix these together with exploitable heuristics I learn from player pool MDA and I have a pretty solid winrate.   No ones playing GTO poker. Everyones trying to, and this has created a whole new opportunity of exploitation.  Everyones trying to play at Nash, but were not computers, so we all have a distance between our actual play and Nash. Its in this distance that you should be exploiting and finding more EV strats to increase your winrate.

Users of this data make it so that casuals are totally outclassed, and and this causes them to reload at a much lower rate than the site or the better players in the pool would prefer.  The only hope when the fish are skinned so rapidly is for some sort of gold rush  poker boom that has people reloading blindly. This happened in the 00s, and Im not sure it will ever happen again at that scale in poker.   On a theoretical level, I think its useful to learn how to exploit certain common lines, but this can often be done with a poker calculator andor a solver with some nodes locked.   As for habits, the best players will adjust their play constantly based on the context. Optimal exploitative strategy is not a set it and forget it type of strategy. As such, any player should be highly suspect of any habit that they have. Furthermore, they should realize that any exploit for a player pool is for that pool, and it may not be generalizable.", "Is your strategy actually optimal vs how your player pool actually plays Maybe, but probably not always.   MDA is just another tool to fine tune your strategy.

I am not very good at doing divisions in my head on the fly when it involves decimal points and whatnot, so I am creating those tables to memorize pot odds. At least calculating the pot ratio on the fly is easy, then I just need to remember this table to know the percentages.  My question is  Am I thinking about this correctly For example, as a general rule, should I fold when pot odds are 50  I mean most of the time, but not always Because this scenario would require a very strong hand like an open ended straight flush.  I mean, from what I have studied so far, the best hand equity you can have with an open ended flush draw is like 54, so I Am assuming that pot odds above that are already an automatic fold if you dont have the nuts", "I think youre a bit confused...   from what I have studied so far, the best hand equity you can have with an open ended flush draw is like 36,   No... The most equity you can have is 100. If you have AA on an AA66 board, you have 100 equity. You cant lose.  As far as draws go, you can have an openended straight flush draw with 2 overcards, which makes you the favourite against a naked top pair on the flop favourite means 50 equity.  If you ever have more than 50 equity, then its always profitable to call an allin, regardless of how big that allin is relative to the pot. They could jam 10,000 into a 50 pot and its still profitable for you to call if you have 51 equity.", " If you have AA on an AA66 board, you have 100 equity  Not in shortdeck baby.

I think the image of looking weak looms larger in our own minds because we know when we are bluffing. Maybe they think you have a weaker hand instead of air and youre smart enough to recognize it rather than chasing.   Strong players fold plenty of times.", "Well, so you bet, hoping your opponent folds after seeing the flop... They call, now were on the Turn and Im first to bet...

I have stopped betting to take control of the hand, or to see where I am at now I bet for value or for bluff only making the bluffs have some equity and not as much pure air   As a result my checks have strengthened and my game is more nuanced than it was before. I am also learning how to arrive at showdown rather than just try and bet everyone out of the pot  I am still learning so that is all just my opinion, but I def understand and feel where you are coming from thinking check shows Im weak now but that gives you great potential if you strengthen your check range. Hope that helps", "In this instance I try to control the size of the pot. When the ace rips while holding kings, Ill either check or bet depending on the player. Weaker players will tend to check behind with or without the ace. You get a free turn card then continue the c bet.

Lets say that my range is A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J  How do I choose 60 of that How do I know If I defend A, B, C, D, E , F instead of E, F, G, H, I, J      Unless I am looking at this completely the wrong way.  Thanks", "The top 60. If you have 10 hands that make it here, you should be calling off the 6 strongest hands.  Edit Strongest in this case is board dependent, obviously. The 60 of hands that make the best calls are your strongest 60, not just by handranking valuation. Ie. AKh is a worse call on 2h 3h 8c Js 10c than AQs .", "If MDF is 60 then you should defend the best 60 of your range.  Note that the best 60 isnt necessarily the strongest 60.

So a better example is this  The board is As Ac Ks 3h 2d  Villain raised preflop on BTN and you called in BB. You checkcalled flop, checkcalled turn and checked river. Now villain goes allin for 500 into a 250 pot.  Youre in an uncomfortable spot because your range is capped and villain could be exploiting you by bluffing into your capped range, so you figure out that you need to defend 33 of your range to reach MDF.  For simplicity, lets say you arrive at this river with exactly 100 combos. You now need to defend 33 combos of hands to this river jam.  So what are the best 33 combos to defend with  Unfortunately theres no AKAQAJ in your range, because you didnt 3bet pre, and theres no 3322 in your range because you called flop, so the best hands to defend might be   6 combos of A3  6 combos of A2  8 combos of AT  8 combos of A9  5 combos of A8 perhaps pick the combos that dont have a spade in them", "You need to adjust it for the number of combos of each hand.
